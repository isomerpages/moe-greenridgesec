# **Physical Education**

#### OUR BELIEFS
The purpose of Physical Education is to enable students to demonstrate the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. We strive to develop every Greenridgean to be physically fit, and to embrace and&nbsp; advocate for a healthy lifestyle.

#### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS
We design our PE programme to enable students to progressively learn knowledge, skills, and values in alignment with the 6 goals of MOEâ€™s Revised PE Syllabus.

We adopt a modified Sport Education Model together with Differentiated Instruction (DI) by roles or tasks to teach PE. This teaching approach is inclusive and allows students of all physical abilities to participate, and experience Imagine, Discover, Express, Achieve and Serve (IDEAS) in learning the different PE modules. 

We use ICT platforms to supplement students with resources for learning. We use formative assessment and feedback to guide our students to acquire the learning outcomes of each module. 

The experience of PE in Greenridge Secondary also includes participation in PE co-curriculum programmes such as Sports Carnival, Annual Cross-country, Team Grit Challenge and Outdoor Adventure Learning Camps. 

Our total PE experience develops students to be confident learners, compassionate leaders, and ethical innovators.
