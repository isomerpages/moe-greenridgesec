# **Cyber Wellness**

The Cyber Wellness (CW) education in GSS is customised to suit GSS’ student profile and school environment. The aim of CW education is to develop Greenridgeans into responsible ICT users who are able to protect themselves and be responsible for their well-being in cyberspace and have good netiquette. Through the various CW activities such as online Cyber Wellness Modules, Workshops, Assembly Talks, Parenting Seminars and CCE lessons conducted in our school, Greenridgeans are constantly reminded of the risks of harmful online behaviour and are given practical tips on how to best protect themselves and others from such behaviours.

Guided by [MOE’s Cyber Wellness framework](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/social-and-emotional-learning/cyber-wellness) which focuses on three key processes: Sense, Think and Act, the school plans and implements a holistic CW education to reinforce the importance of CW and its messages. The framework focuses on developing the child’s instinct to protect him/herself and empowers him/her to take personal responsibility for his/her own well-being in cyberspace.
