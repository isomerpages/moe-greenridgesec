# **Nutrition & Food Science**

### OUR BELIEFS

Our subject is instrumental for the development and honing of practical real-life solving skills for the students. The students would be equipped with the ability to make sense of knowledge and develop critical and inventive thinking skills for the creation of effective solutions in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment.

  
For NFS, we envision our students to demonstrate a sense of responsibility to share nutritional knowledge with family and the community and stay abreast of new developments in culinary and food technology.
