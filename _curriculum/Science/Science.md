### Our Beliefs

The Science curriculum in GSS aims to instill and inspire passion and appreciation for science in our students so that they can apply what they have learnt in their life and the society where they live in. These aims are achieved through the exploration of scientific phenomena in an authentic, practical and experiential setting.

Our students are constantly engaged and inspired by the scientific phenomena and technology around them, and are encouraged to inquire and innovate, with our teachers working closely with them to ensure that our students acquire the knowledge (core ideas), skills (practices) and compass (values, ethics and attitudes) required for the challenges in the 21st century world. Students shall acquire an accomplished level of scientific literacy, to be a knowledgeable citizen who is a confident, self-directed lifelong learner and an active contributor to the community and nation.
