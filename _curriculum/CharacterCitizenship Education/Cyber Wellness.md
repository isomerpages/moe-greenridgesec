# **Cyber Wellness**

The Cyber Wellness (CW) education in GSS is customised to develop Greenridgeans into responsible ICT users who

*   are able to protect themselves
*   be responsible for their well-being in cyberspace
*   have good netiquette

Guided by [MOE’s refreshed Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum](/files/2021%20Character%20and%20Citizenship%20Education%20Syllabus-Secondary.pdf), through the GSS CW programme, students will:

*   Embrace the affordances of technology while maintaining a balanced lifestyle between offline and online activities
*   Be a safe and responsible user of technology and maintain a positive online presence
*   Be responsible for personal well-being in the cyberspace

  

**Integration of Cyber Wellness within the Total Curriculum**

In GSS, we believe values are better caught than taught. Hence the CW experience goes beyond the explicit teaching of desired values and attitudes in CCE lessons. The CW programme is integrated within different curricular and co-curricular programmes to keep learning authentic.

**Media Literacy Ambassador Training**  

 Our Media Literacy Ambassadors (MLAs) heighten the awareness of others to be responsible digital learners when they serve as peer support leaders in the online space.  In this role, they support their schoolmates, advocate for positive cyber etiquette by role-modelling the proper dispositions and inspire their peers through different programmes and student-led initiatives such as:

*   Class-based sharing to facilitate discussion on CW issues with their classmates
*   School-wide sharing during Cyber Wellness Fortnight where MLAs set up CW exhibitions as well as conduct sharing during assembly
