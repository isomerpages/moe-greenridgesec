The 21st Century Competencies are identified as essential competencies and dispositions for students to develop so as to prepare them for the future.





### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS
**1. Overview**<br>
The CCE experience in GSS inspires learning by providing space for students to Imagine, Discover, Express, Accomplish and Serve whilst cultivating Executive Function Skills and Growth Mindset.<br>
Students are taught social emotional competencies and values through the CCE content areas of National Education, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Cyberwellness, Mental Health Education and Sexuality Education.

The CCE 2021 Curriculum Frame presents the CCE curriculum content and how they are internalised by students through a supportive school environment. 





**2. Thinking Frame**<br>
Students use CSI (Clarifying-Sensitising-Influencing) as a thinking frame to help them see multiple perspectives when they engage in discussions on divisive issues or problem solving.  It encourages students to adopt an empathetic approach to understand and make sense of different perspectives and experiences.

**3. Assessing CCE**<br><i>
- How do students know what they need to learn?
- How do they know they have succeeded in learning?
- Can they determine how they want to learn?</i><br>
In asking these questions, we aim to develop our students to be self-directed learners where they are given the space and time to reflect on their learning experiences. Collaborative tools such as Padlet are used to capture feedback from teachers and peers to help students achieve their success criteria.

**4. Contemporary Issues**<br>
Contemporary issues are local topics that are current, relevant and have generated diverse opinions and are conducted during CCE lessons where students share views and personal stories in a safe and conducive environment. This enables students to hear multiple perspectives and encourages them to respect and understand diverse views. A discussion on contemporary issues concludes with students committing to an action for the common good.

**5. National Education**<br>
Students engage in a wide range of NE programmes to experience and explore their national identity as Singaporeans, understand the realities and challenges unique to our nation, and foster a sense of hope and belonging to Singapore. NE in CCE aims to be empowering and aspirational, allowing for individual sense-making, so as to nurture engaged citizens, who are socially aware, adept at critical thinking, and informed about local, regional, and global issues.

**6. Student Development Experiences**<br>
CCE is pervasive in all other student development experiences, such as CCAs, cohort camps and Applied Learning Programmes. With such an array of programmes to meet the diverse developmental needs of students, it is important that they are given opportunities to reflect and make coherent connections across these experiences.

**7. Values in Action (VIA) Programme**<br>
VIA is a key student development experience where students put into action their values and creativity to impact the community. Students explore the needs of the community and then work collaboratively to plan and carry out their VIA.  Through their time in Greenridge Secondary School, VIA aims to instill an enduring sense of purpose in our students to make a positive impact in society.

**8. Education and Career Guidance Programme**<br>
The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme supports our students in achieving their post-secondary aspirations.  Students also focus on building a habit for continuous learning to develop them into lifelong learners.

#### WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP 
It takes a village to raise a child to be a citizen of good character who is resilient and demonstrates strong socio-emotional skills. With strong partnerships between home, school and community, we can work together to develop Greenridgeans as Confident Learners, Compassionate Leaders and Ethical Innovators.
