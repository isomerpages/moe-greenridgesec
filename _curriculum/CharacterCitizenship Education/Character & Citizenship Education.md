# **Character &amp; Citizenship Education**

### Our Beliefs

Our mission is to shape character and instil values and citizenship dispositions. We aim to achieve this through the delivery of a holistic learning experience that is purposeful, centered on students’ learning needs and focused on preparing students for the future.

The global trend of ongoing disruptions generated by a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) environment requires a shift in our teaching approaches.

### How We Engage Our Students

**1\. Overview**

We develop students’ self-awareness, social awareness and responsible decision-making skills through&nbsp; National Education, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Cyberwellness, Mental Health Education and Sexuality Education.&nbsp;&nbsp;

**2\. Thinking Frame**&nbsp;

In CCE, we use CSI (Clarifying-Sensitising-Influencing) as a thinking frame to help students respond responsibly when confronted with controversial issues.&nbsp; It also helps them adopt an empathetic approach to understand different perspectives and make sense of their experiences.

**3\. Assessing CCE**&nbsp;

How do students know what they need to learn? How do they know they have succeeded in learning? Could they determine how they want to learn?&nbsp;

In asking these questions, we seek to develop our students to be Assessment Capable Visible Learners. We provide students with the space for them to reflect and co-construct the success criteria for their learning. As students reflect on their learning experiences using a collaborative tool such as Padlet, teachers can provide feedback to help students internalise their learning.

**4\. Contemporary Issues**  

Contemporary&nbsp; issues consist of topics that are current, relevant to the students and have&nbsp; generated diverse opinions. During CCE lessons, students have the opportunity to share their views and personal stories in a safe and conducive environment. This enables students to hear multiple perspectives and encourages them to respect and understand diverse views. Then the conversation concludes with students committing to act for the common good.

**5\. Student Development Experiences**&nbsp;  

Apart from timetabled lessons, CCE is pervasive in all other student development experiences, such as CCAs, cohort camps and Applied Learning Programmes. With such an array of planned programmes to meet the diverse developmental needs of each academic level, students need to make coherent sense of these experiences. Students are given opportunities to reflect and make connections across these experiences.

**6\. Values in Action (VIA) Programme**&nbsp;&nbsp;

VIA is one of the key student development experiences where students have the opportunity to demonstrate graciousness and play a role in enhancing community spirit and well-being. Weactively reach out to various partners for opportunities where our students can contribute in meeting the needs of the community. As our students make a positive impact in their immediate community, we hope that these experiences help instil in our students an enduring sense of purpose for their lives.

**7\. Education and Career Guidance Programme**&nbsp;

The Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme supports our students in achieving their post-secondary aspirations.&nbsp; ECG also focuses on building an attitude for continuous learning to develop them in lifelong learners during their time in school.&nbsp;

It takes a village to raise a child to be a citizen of good character who is&nbsp; resilient and demonstrates strong socio-emotional skill. With a strong partnership between home, school and community, we&nbsp; can work together to develop Greenridgeans as a caring community of inspired learners.
