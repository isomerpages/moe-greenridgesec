<p>At Greenridge Secondary School, our curriculum is designed to empower
students to become <strong>Champions of Good Causes</strong>. By embracing
our core values of Respect, Integrity, Diligence, Grit, and Empathy, we
nurture students to embody our vision of becoming Confident Learners, Ethical
Innovators, and Compassionate Leaders. With opportunities to imagine, discover,
express, accomplish, and serve (IDEAs), our students are inspired to make
a positive impact on the world.</p>
