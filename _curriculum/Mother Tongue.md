# **Mother Tongue**

### OUR BELIEFS

“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.” Mr Lee Kuan Yew, 1966

Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew for a bilingual Singapore: To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage. Our Mother Tongue Languages and cultures carry many important values and thinking. Mother Tongue plays a critical role for bilingualism in Singapore. Learning of Mother Tongue Languages provides us with a channel to strengthen our core values.

  
Our GSS Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to provide our students with vibrant Mother Tongue Languages and cultural learning experiences, to encourage our students to use their Mother Tongue Languages in their daily lives and develop the passion for the life-long learning of their Mother Tongue Languages.


### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

Our department is committed to providing a variety of platforms for our students’ to enjoy the learning of the Mother Tongue languages and cultures. Through these experiences, our students get to know more about their Mother Tongue languages and cultures in our localized contexts.

  
**Applied Learning Programme**

The integration of the Applied Learning Programme in the MTL total curriculum aims to enhance students’ communication skills, to guide students to&nbsp;

*   understand and appreciate various cultural and literary materials&nbsp;
    
*   strengthen their global and cross-cultural awareness&nbsp;
    
*   apply skills in authentic situations
    

Sec 1 ALP aims to lay a cultural foundation in all students. Students learn to appreciate the meaning and features of their respective MT languages and cultures. Students work in groups to create a product based on the knowledge and skills they have learned while promoting the cultural knowledge to others, such as posters andbookmarks , board games&nbsp; and virtual escape rooms . In Malay Language (ML), after reading short stories with values, students write scripts for radio dramas and create videos. In Tamil Language (TL), after learning the features of various literary texts, such as riddles, traditional customs, and poetry., students create their own magazines&nbsp; to showcase their work and promote the appreciation of literature.

Sec 2 ALP aims to deepen students’ awareness of their MT languages and cultures in the local context. This place an emphasis for students to be more aware and concern of their surroundings as they become more observant. This includes Chinese Language (CL) Xinyao Made in Greenridge!

Sec 3 students are exposed to translation between English Language (EL) and their respective MTL. While strengthening bilingualism, students also experience the commonalities and differences between the two languages, as well as how culture influences communication.  

  

**Festival Celebrations and Mother Tongue Fortnight**  

With the whole school getting together to celebrate Lunar New Year, Hari Raya and Deepavali, our students learn more about the traditions and cultures of the different ethnic groups while cultivating the spirit of sharing and caring. Involvement in the preparation and performance of the different celebrations also allow our students to showcase their various talents. To enable them to learn more about their culture in fun and engaging ways, students also take part in different hands-on activities, such as traditional games and crafts as well as food making workshops.

Performance skills workshops – appreciation and presentations

Through the performance skills workshops, students learn to appreciate the various modes of performances in their MTL and cultures. These workshops also help students to deepen the mastery of skills through authentic learning experiences such as reciting activities, theatre drama appreciation and performances.

Scaffolding Learning

Our learning process in the key language skills are scaffolded in a progressive manner, with various types of support provided to enhance our students’ learning. The use of Socratic questions, mind-maps, group work, as well as modelling and demonstration enhances thinking as students generate ideas and clarify their thoughts.&nbsp; The inclusion of real world experiences in the learning activities makes them highly relatable and applicable to the lives of students.
