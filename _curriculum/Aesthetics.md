### OUR BELIEFS

Arts Education is developed through both the curriculum in Visual Art and Music lessons, as well as the co-curriculum programmes. In line with our school’s Learning for Life Programme, we aim to raise awareness and appreciation of the arts for every student, by providing them with platforms to showcase their artistic potential as well as&nbsp; nurture their talents and passion for the arts.

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

Teachers consider the students’ profile, prior experience and the context that frames their learning. Using pedagogies that allow students to learn through inquiry, experience and reflection, we advocate authentic learning, where students explore, discuss, and meaningfully construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world problems and projects that are relevant to the learner.

  

L Students are also given ample opportunities to go on arts-related learning journeys and attend workshops. Art students visit the National Gallery, the ArtScience Museum, the Singapore Art Museum, the NUS Museum and attend workshops on printmaking and ceramics. The upper secondary Art students visit Institutes of Higher Learning that are related to Arts (e.g. Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts and LaSalle College of the Arts) so that they have a better understanding of their post-secondary educational opportunities. We also invite artists to share about different art techniques such as silk screen printmaking.&nbsp;

  
Music students attend music workshops such as percussion, beatboxing and dikir barat to learn more about music from other cultures. Students also learn to create their own Xinyao songs under the guidance of music professionals.

Students can pursue their interest in Art beyond the classrooms, through participating in interest groups. The Ceramics Interest Group is for students who want to learn more about how to use clays to create artworks. The Docents Interest Group takes charge of sharing artworks with visitors during the school exhibitions. They study the artworks and share the artists’ stories with their audience.

With the opening of our Beyond Imagination Greenridge (BIG) gallery on 26 April 2018, our Art department has been putting up art exhibitions for the community. Our signature art exhibition, Chapters, showcases the artworks of our upper secondary Art students. To make the exhibition more meaningful, we invite students from our neighbouring primary schools to view and learn more about the artworks. During the exhibitions, student docents and artists introduce the artworks to our visitors. Their artworks also inspire the school community to appreciate and understand Visual Art better.
