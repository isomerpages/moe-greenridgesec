**History of the CCE Learning Space** :

The CCE learning space came into being at the end of December 2011.

The space was conceptualized as an interactive corner where students will be exposed to notable individuals who have left a mark not only on Singapore but also the world.

These individuals will also act as role models for the values that we want every GSS students to be imbued with.

	<p><b>More Facts</b><br>He is regarded as one of the founding fathers of independent Singapore as it achieved self-government in 1959 and later independence in 1965. He devoted much of his adult life to public service, and helped shape the mentality of Singaporeans on contemporary issues. One of the schools of Nanyang Technological University, is named the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in honour of him, as is a 7-storey S. Rajaratnam block at Raffles Institution.<br><br>Rajaratnam studied in, St Paul’s boys’ school, Victoria Institution in Kuala Lumpur, and later in Raffles Institution in Singapore. In 1937, he went to King’s College London to pursue a law degree. However, due to World War II, he was unable to receive funding from his family to continue his studies; instead, he turned to journalism to earn a living. He met his wife Piroska Feher, a Hungarian teacher while in London.<br><br>He returned to Singapore in 1948 when he joined the Malayan Tribune. In 1954, he joined _The Straits Times_ as a journalist. He was bold in writing about the way Singapore was governed by the British. This incurred the displeasure of the colonial government. His column, “I write as I please”, attracted so much attention that he was called for questioning by the government.</p>

			<p><h3>Innovation & Technology</h3><p>
			<p><b>Background</b></p>
			<ul><li> Despite its limited physical resources, Singapore is a breeding ground for some outstanding technological developments. The number of patents registered here by local companies, individuals and institutions have been growing steadily.</li>
			<li>Singapore is also one of the top 10 countries registering inventions overseas.</li><li>Innovation and Technology is about improving existing products or inventing new ones to bring convenience to our life. Research and Development is a tertiary industry which emphasises knowledge and creativity over labour. This is suitable for Singapore which has a small population. The Singapore government has thus been encouraging Research and Development by setting up Research Centres of Excellence in our universities, providing billions of dollars in the National Research Fund and also, forming resource centres such as the Games Solution Centre to help small companies develop their products.</li></ul>

			<p><h3>Aerospace</h3></p>
	<p><b>Background</b></p>
			<ul><li> Singapore’s aerospace industry is booming as a result of strong air travel demands in the Asia Pacific region which is forecasted to grow at around 7% till 2020. Beyond the needs of airline operators such as SIA and the booming budget airline industry, as well as Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore’s aerospace industry is largely driven by MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul), manufacturing, research and training.</li>
			<li>Singapore’s positioning as a hub for MRO services translates into great opportunities for this lucrative market, which is currently valued at around US$9 million and plans are already underway in the form of Seletar Aerospace Park which will integrate and attract even more aerospace companies.</li><li>As a result, Singapore needs highly skilled manpower to power the lucrative aviation industry, which is technology driven. The key business in Singapore aviation industry is maintenance, repair and overhaul, largely powered by companies such as SAESL, Rolls Royce, Turbine Overhaul Services, SIA Engineering Company and Singapore Technologies Aerospace. Singapore is also home to manufacturing OEMs and suppliers in engine parts, power systems and cabin retrofitting.</li><li>As the aviation industry grows, there is also a stronger demand for aviation related training in Singapore, with companies such as Boeing and Embraer launching their training and flight services centres for pilots, cabin crew and mechanics in Singapore.</li><li>Aerospace R&D is also growing in collaboration with Boeing, EADS, Rolls Royce, Thales, Pratt and Whitney, General Electric. These companies leverage on the availability of talent in Singapore to develop technology on advanced materials, repair technologies and maintenance know-how to power their aircraft in this cost-competitive industry.</li></ul>
	<p><b>Interesting Facts</b></p>
	<ul><li>Do you know that Singapore has the largest MRO market share in the Asia-Pacific region? The MRO output in Singapore accounts for nearly one-third of Singapore’s aerospace output and is growing at an average rate of 13.3% per year!</li>
			<li>Singapore’s aerospace industry employs more than 18,000 workers, yet they are still facing a serious shortage.</li></ul>
