# **Character & Citizenship Education**

### Our Beliefs

Our mission is to shape character and instil values and citizenship dispositions. We aim to achieve this through the delivery of a holistic learning experience that is purposeful, centered on students’ learning needs and focused on preparing students for the future.

The global trend of ongoing disruptions generated by a VUCA (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous) environment requires a shift in our teaching approaches.

### How We Engage Our Students

1\. Overview

We develop students’ self-awareness, social awareness and responsible decision-making skills through  National Education, Education and Career Guidance, Family Education, Cyberwellness, Mental Health Education and Sexuality Education.  

2\. Thinking Frame 

In CCE, we use CSI (Clarifying-Sensitising-Influencing) as a thinking frame to help students respond responsibly when confronted with controversial issues.  It also helps them adopt an empathetic approach to understand different perspectives and make sense of their experiences.

3\. Assessing CCE 

How do students know what they need to learn? How do they know they have succeeded in learning? Could they determine how they want to learn? 

In asking these questions, we seek to develop our students to be Assessment Capable Visible Learners. We provide students with the space for them to reflect and co-construct the success criteria for their learning. As students reflect on their learning experiences using a collaborative tool such as Padlet, teachers can provide feedback to help students internalise their learning.
