The NE Ambassadors and Champions played an integral role in the planning and execution of the Core NE events in the school. Other than brainstorming ideas for the events, they also took up the key roles in the smooth running of the event through tasks such as researching questions for the Total Defence Day game show and recording of videos for National Day.

The Ambassadors and Champions also represented the school in various external events in the cluster and in the community.
