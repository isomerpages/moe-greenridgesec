# **Principal's Message**

Our **_PRIDE_** (**P**erseverance, **R**esponsibility, **I**ntegrity, **D**iligence, **E**mpathy) values anchor Greenridgeans in their endeavours; indeed, because Greenridgeans hold our _PRIDE_ values and school motto, **_From Each His Best_**, dear to their hearts, they have continued to seize learning opportunities, embark on novel experiences, discover their strengths and passions, and make a positive difference in school and beyond. Navigating the changes have led to the realisation of our remarkable ability to adapt, embrace new learning and our resilience.

As encapsulated in our school mission, **_Shaping Character, Nurturing Learners_**, we are committed to provide a holistic education to Greenridgeans, anchoring them in sound values, and developing in them learning dispositions and attributes for future-readiness. Our positive learning culture and culture of care is bolstered by our strong teacher-student relationships (TSR) and peer support and relationships (PSR). I am grateful to my colleagues who collaborate and invest much time to design meaningful learning experiences for Greenridgeans, as we journey together to build **_A Caring Community of Inspired Learners_**. My appreciation, too, to our School Advisory Committee for your unstinting support, parents for your partnership, alumni and community partners for your collaboration to enrich our students’ learning.    

As we continue to provide rich learning experiences for Greenridgeans, we are also committed to ensure a smooth transition as we prepare for merger with Fajar Secondary School in 2023. Both schools have started planning for merger and more discussions will follow, and the voices of our staff, students and stakeholders will continue to be valued. In the course of the year, we invite you to approach us with your queries and ideas, as we look forward to an exciting new phase. 

**_From Each His Best_**
