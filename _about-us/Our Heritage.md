# Our Heritage 

In 2023, the former Greenridge Secondary School (also previously known as Dunearn Secondary Technical School) and Fajar Secondary School (merged schools of former Fajar Secondary School and Chestnut Drive Secondary School in 2015) merged to become a new school - Greenridge Secondary School. 

The new school is an amalgamation of both schools’ strengths in the areas of uniformed groups, sports, performing arts, Applied Learning and Learning for Life. With these strengths and synergy coming together, the new Greenridge Secondary School looks forward to growing from strength to strength as students experience  a technology-rich learning environment. 

With the merged Greenridge Secondary at Bukit Panjang (long hill), our promise to all students and staff is that, there is space for everyone at Greenridge and together we will scale to the top of the ridge to experience a new Dawn (Fajar)

### Brief Histories of the Schools 

#### Dunearn Secondary Technical School 
GSS was established in 1964 as Dunearn Secondary Technical School (DSTS) at Hillcrest Road. On 14 May 1965, it was officially opened by Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye. DSTS started as a technical school equipped with the best technical facilities available during that time. It was in line with the government's emphasis on meeting Singapore's industrial needs then. DSTS was sited on a small hill sandwiched between Linden Drive and Hillcrest Road.

#### Former Greenridge Secondary School 
In June 1992, DSTS moved out of its Hillcrest site to a new site on Bukit Panjang Ring Road. With the move, the school was given a new identity. DSTS was renamed Greenridge Secondary School to reflect the lush greenery and its location in "Bukit Panjang", which means "ridge" in Malay. This new identity also brought about a change in the demographics of the school, where there was a balance in the male and female student ratio befitting its co-educational status. The school was officially declared open on 16 July 1994 by Mr Lee Yiok Seng, Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Labour and MP for Sembawang GRC. The school is one of the pioneer secondary schools in Bukit Panjang area and has hosted two other schools, Fajar Secondary School and Zhenghua Secondary School.![](/images/OUR_HERITAGE2023/4%20construction%20of%20gss%20.jpeg)

#### Chestnut Drive Secondary School

She started as a Chinese Integrated School with an enrolment figure of 787. The school was officially opened on 12 June 1969 by then Member of Parliament, Mr. P. Selvadurai. The school was situated in a private residential district in Upper Bukit Timah. It was built to serve a vast area, with students coming from Woodlands, Jurong, Bukit Batok, Choa Chu Kang and even Yishun. The school conducted classes for both the English and Chinese streams. The school operated on two different streams – the Chinese stream and the English stream – for 19 years until the Chinese stream was phased out in 1987. In 1988, the school converted from a double session (morning session and afternoon session) to a single session.

With an enrolment of 307 students and a teaching strength of 17 teachers, the former Fajar Secondary School (FSS) started functioning at its temporary premises at Greenridge Secondary School in 1994. The former Fajar Secondary School moved to its current premises at 31 Gangsa Road.
