Anchored in our RIDGE values (Respect, Integrity, Diligence, Grit, Empathy) and motto (Together Onward), our students will embrace the strength of diversity and team spirit. A place for IDEAS (Imagination, Discovery, Expression, Accomplishment and Service), we reimagine the joy of learning for life and nurture a Growth Mindset in our students.<br><br>
Together, we develop in our students the 5 Minds for the Future (Disciplined, Synthesising, Creating, Respectful and Ethical minds); We shape them to be Compassionate Leaders,  and inspire them to become Confident Learners and Ethical Innovators.</font>
