# **Code Of Conduct**


<font size =4>Our school’s code of conduct provides moral compass for us to grow into confident learners, compassionate leaders and ethical innovators. We live by the code of conduct both within and beyond the school premises, especially when we can be identified as Greenridgeans. Should we fall short of our code of conduct, we will recognise our misconduct, face consequences with the right attitude, relearn and restore by practising more of the desired behaviour.

##### **C**lassroom Cleanliness / Personal Grooming

Every class must have a roster where students are rostered daily to ensure that the classroom is neat and clean before any teacher starts a lesson.

Every student must be neatly attired and groomed. Extra ear studs and ear sticks must be confiscated immediately. There must be a sense of neatness and tidiness in the class.

##### **H**omework Submission

Every class must have subject representatives to collect homework. All homework submission must be recorded and dated against the class lists. Immediate follow-up actions will be taken against students who fail to submit the homework. The students will be asked to move to a side of the classroom, have their desks turned facing the back of the classroom and complete their homework while the rest of the class proceed with the lesson.

##### **A**ttendance Monitoring 

Every subject teacher must personally account for the attendance of every student in the class. He/She must record the reason for absence or latecoming of any student who is absent or late for class.

##### **M**aterials on the Students’ Desks
Every student must have all the necessary learning materials ready for every lesson on their desks.

##### **P**urpose of Learning in the Lesson

Every subject teacher must write on the class whiteboard the purpose or objectives of learning for every lesson. If the subject teacher places the objectives of the lesson on PowerPoint slides, these must be repeated through the lesson as the lesson objectives serve as a navigation guide for the lesson.
