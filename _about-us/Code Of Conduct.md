##### **C**lassroom Cleanliness / Personal Grooming

Every class must have a roster where students are rostered daily to ensure that the classroom is neat and clean before any teacher starts a lesson.

Every student must be neatly attired and groomed. Extra ear studs and ear sticks must be confiscated immediately. There must be a sense of neatness and tidiness in the class.

##### **H**omework Submission

Every class must have subject representatives to collect homework. All homework submission must be recorded and dated against the class lists. Immediate follow-up actions will be taken against students who fail to submit the homework. The students will be asked to move to a side of the classroom, have their desks turned facing the back of the classroom and complete their homework while the rest of the class proceed with the lesson.
