<h4>OUR BELIEFS&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In Greenridge Secondary School’s Rugby team, we believe that:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All players can be trained and developed into true sportsmen, regardless
of their starting point.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Teamwork is the beauty of our sports. All of us work as one, towards a
common goal. All players will emerge stronger and fitter, mentally and
physically.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We aim to develop students who display the school values of Respect, Integrity,
Diligence, Grit and Empathy&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>QUOTES FROM OUR RUGBY BOYS</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>“Personally, rugby has taught me to have more self-discipline. For example,
showing up and taking our training sessions seriously. Despite needing
to train under unpredictable weather, it has taught me how to **adapt to
different challenges. During the fasting period, it teaches me not to give
up easily and persevere in training with the support from the teachers,
coaches and the rest of the team. This leads the team to have stronger
team morale as we will have to learn and accept one another despite the
team’s unique character. Rugby has taught me self-discipline, adaptability,
and perseverance. With the support from the teachers, coaches and the rest
of the team, we strive to give our best for every game.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muhamad Amran Bin Mazli, Sec 4 (2023)&nbsp;</p>
