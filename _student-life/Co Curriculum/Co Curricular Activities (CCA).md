# Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)

### OUR BELIEFS
Co-curricular activities (CCA) are necessary and important in the life of a student. CCA is part of the holistic education delivered in an authentic setting. We believe CCA develops and strengthens core values and 21st Century Competencies and enhances the joy of learning.

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

Every CCA owns a Student Development Plan (SDP) designed to enable students to progressively learn knowledge, skills and values pertaining to the uniqueness of their CCA. Through CCA involvement, students will get to experience Imagine, Discover, Express, Achieve and Serve (IDEAS). CCA learning experience enables the school to develop confident learners, compassionate leaders, and ethical innovators. 

Every year, we review our CCA programmes to ensure that it is well-aligned with our school Vision, Mission, and Values. We evaluate the quality of our CCA programmes to ensure it will allow our students achieve their personal best in the overall CCA LEAPS 2.0 attainment.

Every student must participate in one core CCA. 

To develop grit, we encourage students to stay committed to one CCA throughout their 4 or 5 years of secondary school education. We allow CCA transfer only for valid reasons such as a change in medical condition and we only allow CCA transfer one time. Students with high aspirations to participate in two CCAs can do so if they demonstrate good character and have the approval from CCA teachers and parents.

These are CCAs that will be offered in 2024:


| Uniformed Youth Organisations| Visual and Performing Arts	 | Physical Sports and Games |Clubs and Societies |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |-------- |
| Girls’ Brigade (Girls) | Concert Band  | Football (Boys)    |Infocomm Technology (Media Production)    |

### CCA Orientation and CCA Selection Try-outs

All Secondary Ones will participate in CCA orientation and selection try-outs held in January over 2 weeks. We will inform students of the schedule for CCA try-outs at the start of the year. Secondary Ones will try-out for all CCAs before submitting their 3 CCA options. One of their 3 choices must include a Uniformed Youth Organisation because we believe UYO is strongest in capacity to develop student leadership skills. We will allocate students to a CCA that is most suitable for them based on the matching of their choices and results from the selection try-outs. New students joining the school in Secondary Two or Secondary Three will be allocated CCA of their choice.


### CCA Practice

Tuesday and Thursday are our official CCA practice days. CCAs typically start their practice at 3.00 pm and end at 5.30 pm or 6.00 pm. We advise students to stay in school to complete their homework before the start of CCA practice. 

To develop diligence and grit, CCAs would include additional practice days during their competition seasons. CCAs also conduct training camps during weekends or school holidays to strengthen teamwork and skills among members. Some of these camps are mandatory as it will determine student leadership roles or school team selection. We advise students to check their CCA holiday training plan before booking for overseas travels. 

We will also inform parents via Parents’ Gateway should there be any change to the regular practice scheduled. CCA will stand-down on the following occasions: <br>
●	two weeks before examinations <br>
●	public holidays <br>
●	Awards’ Day<br>
●	National Day Celebrations<br>
●	Teachers’ Day Celebrations<br>
●	Parent-Child-Teacher Conference <br>
●	Graduation Day<br>


### GSS Games Day and Open House
