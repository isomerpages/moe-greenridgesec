### Our Beliefs

The Science curriculum in GSS aims to instill and inspire passion and appreciation for science in our students so that they can apply what they have learnt in their life and the society where they live in. These aims are achieved through the exploration of scientific phenomena in an authentic, practical and experiential setting.

Our students are constantly engaged and inspired by the scientific phenomena and technology around them, and are encouraged to inquire and innovate, with our teachers working closely with them to ensure that our students acquire the knowledge (core ideas), skills (practices) and compass (values, ethics and attitudes) required for the challenges in the 21st century world. Students shall acquire an accomplished level of scientific literacy, to be a knowledgeable citizen who is a confident, self-directed lifelong learner and an active contributor to the community and nation.

### How We Engage Our Students

In alignment to the national Science curriculum framework and the inherent nature of Science learning through inquiry, GSS adopts a guided inquiry approach to the teaching and learning of Science in GSS. This includes the acquisition of Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes in Science through practical sessions, authentic application and making thinking visible using Thinking Routines.&nbsp;

Through the Scientific Practices approach, teachers and students ‘behave like a scientist’ throughout the learning process. This means that they consistently observe, question, think, articulate and write, using the precise terms and accurate illustrations when describing the various scientific concepts, akin to a scientist. Models, demonstration kits and other manipulatives are used extensively to further provide a tactile learning experience that enhances the students’ understanding and grasp of the science concepts.&nbsp;

In particular, GSS adopts the 5E Inquiry Approach (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to facilitate and implement the progressive and differentiated Science curriculum.

*   Sec 1:&nbsp; Students are engaged in interactive lessons that cover the General Science disciplines of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, to inspire them with a lifelong interest in the sciences. They are also encouraged to explore the world constantly through questioning and experimentation, so that they develop a strong sense of scientific literacy in terms of scientific knowledge, critical thinking skills and essential attitudes, which are crucial for the 21st century.  
      
    
*   Sec 2:&nbsp; Students build on their fundamental Science knowledge, skills and attitudes to enhance their scientific literacy in order to explain scientific phenomena and experimental results with the use of keywords and key phrases.  
    

* Sec 3, 4 and 5:&nbsp; Students deepen theirscientific knowledge, skills and attitudes&nbsp; and extend their learning by analyzing data and evaluating authentic real-life problems.

A team of Secondary 2 students participated in the Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF) 2023, which revolved around the theme 'Science for Sustainable Living.' They earned a Commendation Award for their project titled 'Finding the most suitable color for T-shirts during extremely hot weather.' 

1. Inspired Inquiry: Our students began by keenly observing their surroundings and drawing inspiration from their science lessons. Their objective was clear: to address the challenges posed by the relentless heat.

2. Scientific Methodology: With guidance from their science teacher, they meticulously planned a scientific approach to test their hypotheses.

3. Data Collection and Analysis: The team collected data to support their findings. This rigorous process not only validated their hypothesis but also provided valuable insights into the choice of colours and materials for clothes in extreme heat.

4. Effective Communication: They then prepared a project report and a video presentation to effectively communicate their findings and the importance of their research.


#### Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO) 2023

As the key shifts in our Science education include providing students with more opportunities for interdisciplinary learning in STEM and encouraging students to learn for life, the secondary 1 students embarked on a journey to grow vegetables in the school’s vertical garden and Vegepods. 

They completed the entire process, from germinating the seeds and transplanting them into the proper growth beds to watching the vegetables grow and harvesting them for donation to our neighbours.

##### Secondary 1’s Water Filtration System

Our Secondary 1 students embraced the power of collaboration and innovation as they worked together in groups on this inspiring project. They brainstormed creative ideas, conducted thorough research, and placed their theories to the test to construct an efficient water filtration system. Using the provided materials, they're on a mission to turn contaminated water into clean water. This hands-on experience not only sharpens their problem-solving skills but also reinforces the importance of teamwork and environmental stewardship.

##### Making a Terrarium in Secondary 2 Science

In an exciting STEM activity, our Secondary 2 students built terrariums. This hands-on project allowed them to delve into several key aspects of science. They not only constructed functional terrariums but also grasped the water cycle and the vital role plants play in it. Furthermore, they learned about the significance of maintaining a harmonious ecosystem within these mini-worlds. This engaging experience not only fostered their scientific knowledge but also instilled a deeper appreciation for environmental sustainability. Our students' enthusiasm for learning shines through in their creative terrariums, showcasing their commitment to STEM education.
