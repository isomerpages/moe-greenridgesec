### OUR BELIEFS
In the Department of English Language and Literature of GSS, we aim to develop our Greenridgeans to become:
- empathetic and confident communicators
- discerning and critical readers
- creative inquirers
- creative meaning makers
- global and empathetic thinkers

We create opportunities for students to: 
- Imagine possibilities and perspectives through immersive and engaging activities such as role-play, hot-seating, and drama  
- discover a variety of themes, topics and perspectives through reading and viewing a range of texts, and conducting independent research 
- Express themselves and share their opinions confidently during group discussions, debates and presentations, as well as in their writing
