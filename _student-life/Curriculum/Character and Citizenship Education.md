<h1><strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong><em>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Character and Citizenship</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, <strong>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</strong> lies
at the heart of our mission to nurture values-driven, future-ready learners.
Guided by our school motto <em>Together Onward</em> and our <strong>RIDGE values</strong> — <em>Respect, Integrity, Diligence, Grit</em> and <em>Empathy</em> —
we aim to shape Greenridge Champions who are ready for life, learning,
and leadership.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCE provides purposeful and student-centred learning experiences that
inspire our Champions to imagine, discover, express, accomplish, and serve.
Through these experiences, they grow into <strong>Confident Learners, Compassionate Leaders, and Ethical Innovators</strong>,
equipped to make responsible decisions and meaningful contributions to
the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Our Approach to CCE</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>CCE at Greenridge goes beyond knowledge — it is about developing character,
resilience, and empathy through reflection and real-world application.
Our curriculum integrates <strong>Social-Emotional Learning, National Education, Family Education, Cyberwellness, Mental Health, Sexuality Education, and Education &amp; Career Guidance (ECG)</strong> to
provide a holistic foundation for our students’ moral, social, and emotional
growth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of CCE at Greenridge is the emphasis on <strong>Executive Function Skills (EFS)</strong> and
a <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>. These skills help students become self-directed
learners who can plan ahead, stay focused, manage emotions, and reflect
meaningfully on their actions — key traits for success in an ever-changing
world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using thinking tools such as the <strong>CSI (Clarifying–Sensitising–Influencing) Frame</strong> and <strong>Paul’s Elements of Thought (EOT)</strong>,
students learn to analyse issues critically and from multiple perspectives.
They identify assumptions, examine viewpoints, and make thoughtful connections
between purpose, evidence, and implications. Through this process, they
develop empathy for others and engage in responsible, values-based decision-making
that strengthens their character and moral reasoning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCE learning also extends beyond the classroom through <strong>National Education commemorations, cohort camps, CCAs, Values in Action (VIA)</strong>,
and our signature <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong>, ensuring
that character formation is holistic, lived, and sustained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP): Learn to Champion for a Cause (LCC)</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Our <strong>Learning for Life Programme (LLP)</strong> — <em>Learn to Champion for a Cause</em> —
brings CCE to life through authentic, values-driven action. It empowers
every Greenridge Champion to be a changemaker who identifies community
issues, designs solutions, and takes meaningful action to make a positive
difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guided by Design Thinking and the CSI Thinking Frame, students empathise
with real community needs, prototype creative ideas, and implement purposeful
projects that benefit others. In the process, they strengthen their sense
of empathy, innovation, and responsibility — learning to lead with both
heart and mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Signature LLP experiences include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Innovation Projects</strong> on inclusivity, sustainability,
and mental well-being&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborations with Community and Industry Partners</strong> to
extend learning beyond school&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The LLP embodies our belief that every Greenridge Champion can be a <strong>Champion for a Cause</strong> —
one who leads with compassion, creativity, and conviction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Character and Citizenship Education through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>CCE at Greenridge is guided by the <strong>IDEAS</strong> framework — <em>Imagine, Discover, Express, Accomplish,</em> and <em>Serve</em> —
which captures the developmental journey of our students as they translate
values into purposeful action.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Champions imagine their place in society and the possibilities for
their future. Using the CSI Thinking Frame, they learn to see issues from
multiple perspectives and develop empathy for others. During commemorations
like Total Defence Day and Racial Harmony Day, they envision what it means
to contribute to a strong, united Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discover</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the diverse domains of CCE — from National Education to Cyberwellness
and ECG — Champions discover values, life skills, and their personal strengths.
LLP experiences and <strong>Applied Learning Modules (ApLM)</strong> further
help them uncover resilience, teamwork, and leadership through authentic,
hands-on learning that connects classroom knowledge with real-world applications.</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Champions express their voices through reflection, dialogue, and creative
sharing. They engage in class discussions, digital reflections, and project
presentations where diverse perspectives are respected. Through LLP and
VIA projects, they express their convictions and pride in making a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Champions set goals, take action, and celebrate achievements as they
grow in confidence and perseverance. Whether through cohort camps, CCAs,
or community projects, they learn the value of teamwork and persistence.
In LLP initiatives, they design and execute impactful projects, translating
ideas into real-world outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service is the heartbeat of CCE at Greenridge. Through VIA and LLP, our
Champions live out empathy and responsibility by serving others — in school,
in the community, and for the nation. They learn that service is not just
about volunteering, but about making sustained, ethical contributions that
build a better Singapore and a better world.&nbsp;</p>
