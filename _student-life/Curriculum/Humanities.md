<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Thought and Action&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, the Humanities shape our Greenridge Champions
into confident, compassionate learners who think critically, act responsibly,
and champion positive change. Through Geography, History, and Social Studies,
they explore real-world issues, develop global awareness, and learn to
lead with purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We aim to nurture confident, compassionate learners who think critically, act responsibly, and champion positive change.</strong> Greenridge
Champions grow into persuasive communicators, reflective learners, and
changemakers who use their knowledge to contribute meaningfully to society.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Our Greenridge Champions re-create past worlds and envision possible futures by stepping into the perspectives of others.</strong> In <strong>History</strong>,
they become spice traders through authentic sensory experiences such as
tasting and smelling spices, or imagine their future through the creation
of a personal time capsule that captures their hopes and reflections. In <strong>Geography</strong>,
they construct models of volcanoes and sea-floor spreading, helping them
to visualise powerful natural processes and imagine how landscapes evolve
over time. In <strong>Social Studies</strong>, they take part in a mock
voting exercise, evaluating political parties from Singapore’s early years
and casting their own ballots to imagine the challenges and choices faced
in nation-building.</p>

<p>Through <strong>Inquiry-Based Learning</strong> and the <strong>Elements of Thought</strong> framework,
our Greenridge Champions investigate issues by carrying out fieldwork,
analysing sources, and engaging in inquiry projects. In <strong>Geography</strong>,
they use instruments to collect and analyse data during field investigations,
and deepen their learning through authentic experiences such as interviewing
residents at Kampong Glam to study the impacts of tourism, or visiting
the Science Centre to explore how earthquakes shape lives and landscapes.
In <strong>History </strong>and<strong> Social Studies</strong>, they examine
artefacts, oral histories, and documents at the National Museum of Singapore,
uncovering diverse perspectives of the past. They also explore turning
points through in-house designed board games that simulate historical decisions
and strategies. ICT plays an important role as students participate in
interactive online discussions, conduct digital research, and present their
findings using technology. These experiences extend their learning beyond
the classroom and help them uncover patterns and perspectives that shape
our world.</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p></p>
<p>Our Greenridge Champions communicate their insights with clarity, empathy,
and confidence. In the classroom, they present findings, engage in debates,
and share perspectives on contemporary issues through discussions, role-plays,
and collaborative projects. Beyond school, platforms such as the Harvard
Model United Nations (HMUN) provide opportunities for them to represent
UN Councils, practise diplomacy, and refine persuasive communication. Through
self and peer evaluation, they reflect on their learning and strengthen
their voice as expressive, independent learners.</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Greenridge Champions demonstrate their skills at national-level platforms
such as the NUS Geography Challenge, History Challenge, and the Model ASEAN
Summit, where they discuss meaningful societal issues with peers from across
Singapore. These experiences stretch their thinking and affirm their ability
to apply classroom learning in competitive and collaborative arenas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Humanities education empowers our Greenridge Champions to act on what
they learn. Guided by inquiry and empathy, they apply their understanding
to serve the nation, society, and environment. Through initiatives such
as environmental awareness campaigns, community partnerships, and heritage
appreciation projects, they translate learning into action, strengthening
their sense of identity, responsibility, and purpose as active citizens
of Singapore and the world.</p>
