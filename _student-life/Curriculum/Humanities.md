<h1><strong>Humanities (Social Studies, History and Geography)</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Thought and Action&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, the Humanities shape our Greenridge Champions
into confident, compassionate learners who think critically, act responsibly,
and champion positive change. Through Geography, History, and Social Studies,
they explore real-world issues, develop global awareness, and learn to
lead with purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>We aim to nurture confident, compassionate learners who think critically, act responsibly, and champion positive change.</strong> Greenridge
Champions grow into persuasive communicators, reflective learners, and
changemakers who use their knowledge to contribute meaningfully to society.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Humanities through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Greenridge Champions <strong>re-create past worlds and envision possible futures by stepping into the perspectives of others</strong>.
In History, they become spice traders through authentic sensory experiences
such as <strong>tasting and smelling spices</strong>, or explore turning
points through <strong>in-house designed board games</strong> that simulate
historical decisions and strategies. In Geography, they construct <strong>models of volcanoes and sea-floor spreading</strong>,
helping them to visualise powerful natural processes and imagine how landscapes
evolve over time. In Social Studies, they take part in a <strong>mock voting exercise</strong>,
evaluating political parties from Singapore’s early years and casting their
own ballots to imagine the challenges and choices faced in nation-building.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discover</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through <strong>Inquiry-Based Learning</strong> and the <strong>Elements of Thought framework</strong>,
our Greenridge Champions investigate issues by carrying out fieldwork,
analysing sources, and engaging in inquiry projects. In Geography, they
use instruments to collect and analyse data during <strong>field investigations</strong>,
and deepen their learning through <strong>authentic experiences such as interviewing residents at Kampong Glam </strong>to
study the impacts of tourism, or visiting the <strong>Science Centre </strong>to
explore how earthquakes shape lives and landscapes<strong>.</strong> In
History, they examine artefacts, oral histories, and documents at the <strong>National Museum of Singapore</strong>,
uncovering diverse perspectives of the past. ICT also plays an important
role, as students participate in interactive online discussions, conduct
digital research, and present their findings using technology. These experiences
extend their learning beyond the classroom and help them uncover patterns
and perspectives that shape our world.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our Greenridge Champions communicate their insights with clarity,
empathy, and confidence. In the classroom, they <strong>present findings, engage in debates, and share perspectives on contemporary issues</strong>. <strong>Gamification</strong> in
History lessons—through in-house designed board games that simulate historical
decisions and war strategies—enables them to express their understanding
in creative and interactive ways. Beyond school, platforms such as <strong>Harvard Model United Nations (HMUN)</strong> give
them opportunities to represent UN Councils, practise diplomacy, and refine
persuasive communication. Through self and peer evaluation, they also reflect
on their learning and strengthen their voice as expressive, independent
learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenridge Champions demonstrate their skills at national-level platforms
such as the NUS Geography Challenge, History Challenge, and the Model ASEAN
Summit, where they discuss meaningful societal issues with peers from across
Singapore. These experiences stretch their thinking and affirm their ability
to apply classroom learning in competitive and collaborative arenas.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Humanities education empowers our Greenridge Champions to act on what
they learn. Guided by inquiry, they not only gather and analyse data but
also propose actions related to environmental and societal issues. In Social
Studies, they engage in discussions on contemporary concerns, reflecting
on how they can play their part as active citizens who contribute to Singapore
and the world.&nbsp;</p>
