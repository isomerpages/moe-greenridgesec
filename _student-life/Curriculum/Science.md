<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Inquiry and Innovation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Science curriculum at Greenridge Secondary seeks to inspire passion,
curiosity, and appreciation for the sciences. Our Greenridge Champions<strong> are encouraged to explore scientific phenomena in authentic, practical, and experiential settings that nurture both knowledge and wonder</strong>.
Science lessons focus not just <strong>on core ideas, but also on the values, ethics, and attitudes that shape responsible learners who think critically about the world around them</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through guided inquiry and hands-on experimentation, our Greenridge Champions
behave like scientists as they observe, question, test, and evaluate ideas.
They are constantly engaged and inspired by the science and technology
around them, and are encouraged to inquire and innovate under the close
guidance of their teachers. In the process, they acquire the knowledge,
skills, and compass to thrive in a rapidly changing world. By cultivating
strong scientific literacy, we aim to develop confident, self-directed
learners and active contributors who apply science meaningfully to life,
society, and the environment.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Science through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>Our Greenridge Champions spark their imagination through hands-on STEM
activities that encourage creativity and innovation. In Secondary 1, they
design <strong>water filtration systems</strong> to turn contaminated water
into clean water, applying their knowledge in novel ways. Secondary 2s
create <strong>terrariums</strong>, envisioning how ecosystems sustain themselves
in mini-worlds. Through such projects, students imagine how science can
be applied to solve authentic global challenges such as sustainability,
clean water, and climate change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Champions discover science by observing, investigating, and experimenting
with the world around them. Using the <strong>5E Inquiry Approach</strong> (Engage,
Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate), they build conceptual understanding
through questioning, collecting data, and testing hypotheses. For example,
Secondary 1 students explore sustainability through the <strong>Farm-to-Table programme</strong>,
where they germinate seeds, cultivate vegetables in vertical gardens, and
donate their harvest to the community. Visits to science exhibitions and
the use of models, demonstration kits, and manipulatives allow students
to discover scientific concepts in authentic and meaningful ways.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Champions express their learning by communicating like scientists — questioning,
writing, and presenting findings with clarity and precision. In the <strong>Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF)</strong>,
Sec 2 students articulated their research on sustainable clothing choices
through detailed reports and video presentations. In classrooms, students
present their data, construct scientific explanations, and use digital
tools to showcase their work. These opportunities allow them to refine
their scientific voice and share their insights with peers, teachers, and
wider audiences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Greenridge Champions achieve excellence through authentic application
and competition. In the <strong>Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO) 2023</strong>,
22 students represented GSS, with two earning Gold Medals and one receiving
a Merit Award — remarkable accomplishments that reflect their dedication
and perseverance. At SYSF, Sec 2 students earned a <strong>Commendation Award</strong> for
their innovative project on clothing and heat. Within school, Champions
accomplish milestones through lab experiments, performance tasks, and long-term
STEM projects that stretch their problem-solving and collaborative skills.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Science at Greenridge nurtures values of responsibility and care for the
environment. In the <strong>Farm-to-Table Movement</strong>, students harvest
vegetables from their school gardens and donate them to neighbours, linking
science learning to service for the community. By engaging in sustainability
projects, environmental initiatives, and collaborative STEM work, they
learn that science is not only about knowledge but also about applying
it to serve humanity and the planet.&nbsp;</p>
