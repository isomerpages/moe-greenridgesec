### OUR BELIEFS
Arts Education is developed through both the curriculum in Visual Art and Music lessons, as well as the co-curriculum programmes. Our curriculum allows our students to develop their interests and talents by providing opportunities for studentsâ€™ creative and innovative self-expression in varied modes.  
 
### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS
Students have opportunities to learn through inquiry, experience and reflection. We advocate authentic learning, where students explore, discuss, and meaningfully construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world problems and projects that are relevant to the learner.

Students are able to create artworks through their imagination and innovation by working on authentic art tasks. This project-based learning also allows students to work collaboratively, a chance for students to respond, sharing knowledge and ideas to develop authentic solutions while dealing with real-world issues. 

Music lessons provide students with authentic hands-on learning experiences and exposure to a range of music genres and context, with music technology being an integral part of learning.
