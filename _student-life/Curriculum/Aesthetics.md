<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Creativity and Innovation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Aesthetics curriculum at Greenridge Secondary empowers our Greenridge
Champions to express themselves creatively and think inventively. Through
Visual Art, Music, and Design &amp; Technology, they learn to imagine new
possibilities, design meaningful solutions, and communicate ideas through
diverse modes of expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arts education nurtures students’ appreciation of culture and aesthetics,
while D&amp;T develops practical problem-solving skills and inventive thinking.
Together, these disciplines encourage our Champions to engage with real-world
issues, collaborate with peers, and design purposeful solutions for a rapidly
changing world.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Aesthetics through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Our Greenridge Champions harness creativity to dream, design, and innovate
through authentic art projects, music-making, and design prototypes.</p>

<p>In <strong>Art</strong>, they imagine new possibilities through drawing,
painting, and digital art. Exploring identity, culture, and imagination,
they transform ideas into visuals that inspire and reimagine the world
around them.</p>

<p>In <strong>Music,</strong> they explore sound and rhythm to create original
compositions and fresh interpretations. Whether experimenting with digital
tools or preparing for 15 Minutes of Fame, they turn ideas into melodies
that move and connect people.</p>

<p>In <strong>D&amp;T</strong>, they engage in Design Thinking, doodling,
sketching, and 3D modelling to design purposeful solutions for real-world
challenges.&nbsp;Their imagination comes alive in projects such as an Egg
Holder, a Drinking Can Dispenser, and a Mini Compost Bin. Larger-scale
challenges like the Powered Toy Car, the Eco Pedal Boat Challenge, and
Eco Glow Up – Innovating through Upcycling further showcase how creativity
and invention reign in our programmes.&nbsp;</p>

<br>Learning is grounded in <strong>inquiry, exploration, and experimentation</strong>.
In Art, Champions explore concepts, symbols, and contexts to understand
how art reflects society. In Music, they discover diverse genres and cultures
while using technology to enhance learning. In D&amp;T, they deepen their
knowledge of mechanisms, electronics, and materials, discovering how science
and creativity merge to create practical solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
<br>Champions <strong>articulate their creativity through hands-on, collaborative projects</strong>.
In Art, they create works that convey meaning and emotion. In Music, they
perform, improvise, and use music technology to express their ideas. In
D&amp;T, Champions make mock-ups, prototypes, and functional products<strong>, </strong>testing
and refining their designs while learning to present their ideas with clarity. <strong>Gamification, peer feedback, and online collaborative platforms</strong> further
enhance the way they express and share their learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;</p>
