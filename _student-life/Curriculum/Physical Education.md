<h1><strong>Physical Education</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Growing Champions&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, Physical Education aims to nurture Greenridge
Champions<strong> who value outdoor physical activity and embrace healthy living</strong>.
We strive to equip every student with the <strong>skills, habits, and values</strong> needed
to lead an <strong>active lifestyle </strong>and <strong>sustain lifelong physical and mental well-being</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>PE develop our Champions progressively in alignment with MOE’s six goals:
acquiring a broad range of movement skills, applying movement concepts
and strategies, practising safe behaviours, demonstrating positive social
values, maintaining health-enhancing fitness, and appreciating the value
of an active lifestyle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through sports, outdoor education, and health-focused programmes, PE empowers
our Champions to grow as confident learners, compassionate leaders, and
ethical innovators.&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Physical Education through IDEAS&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Our Greenridge Champions imagine possibilities through diverse physical
activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In modules such as <strong>territorial-invasion, net-barrier, and field-putting games</strong>,
they explore creative strategies and teamwork. In outdoor education, activities
like <strong>shelter-building, orienteering, and outdoor cooking competitions</strong> give
them the chance to think innovatively in authentic settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Discover</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Champions discover the joy of movement and the science of fitness through <strong>sprints, cross-country, and NAPFA training</strong>,
supported by ICT platforms that extend learning. In the <strong>Sports Education Programme (SEP)</strong>,
they explore new and unconventional sports, from martial arts to water
sports, discovering passions that extend beyond the PE syllabus.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Express.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Champions express themselves through <strong>active participation and collaboration</strong>,
demonstrating resilience and teamwork during key events such as the Sports
Carnival, Cross-Country, Our Vitality, and Dance of the Nation. The Recess
Play Programme (RPP) further promotes unstructured play, offering students
the freedom to explore creativity, take initiative, and strengthen social
bonds through movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Greenridge Champions demonstrate accomplishment through completing outdoor
expeditions and fitness challenges. Programmes such as the Outdoor Adventure
Learning Camps and the MOE-OBS Challenge provide meaningful opportunities
for students to take on demanding tasks that build ruggedness, courage,
and resourcefulness. Through level-wide runs, inter-class sports, and physical
fitness assessments, they set personal goals, monitor their progress, and
grow in confidence in their physical abilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through physical activity, our Greenridge Champions learn to serve others
by <strong>practicing safe behaviours, encouraging their peers, and leading by example. </strong>Whether
they are motivating classmates during <strong>NAPFA</strong>, helping to
organise school events, or promoting healthy living, they cultivate responsibility
and empathy—contributing to a caring and inclusive school community&nbsp;</p>
