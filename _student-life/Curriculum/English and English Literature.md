<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Voice and Imagination</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The English Language and Literature Department at Greenridge Secondary
School nurtures our Greenridge Champions to be <strong>empathetic and confident communicators,</strong>  <strong>discerning and critical readers</strong>,
and <strong>creative inquirers</strong>. Through language and literature,
they <strong>grow into global thinkers who appreciate diverse perspectives and express themselves with clarity and conviction</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Greenridge Champions explore possibilities and perspectives through
immersive activities such as <strong>role-play, hot-seating, and drama</strong>,
which spark creativity and deepen empathy. They also reimagine their Literature
texts in innovative ways, for example, by <strong>producing an original book trailer</strong> for
Don’t Know, Don’t Care as part of the National Schools’ Literature Festival.
These experiences allow our Greenridge Champions to <strong>step into different worlds, experiment with storytelling forms, and imagine new ways of expressing human experiences</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Through the <strong>Extensive Reading Programme</strong> and exposure to
a wide range of texts and media, our Greenridge Champions encounter diverse
ideas, themes, and viewpoints that broaden their understanding of the world.
They also <strong>learn beyond the classroom, attending theatre productions of their Literature texts, engaging in post-show discussions with directors and actors</strong>,
and experiencing how the written word comes alive on stage. These authentic
encounters deepen their appreciation of language, culture, and human experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<br>Our Greenridge Champions build confidence through <strong>class debates, public speaking platforms, persuasive writing tasks, and oracy-focused programmes</strong>.
The <strong>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in English Language</strong> further
develops persuasive communication and presentation skills, preparing them
for authentic real-world contexts. Beyond the classroom, they also engage
with practitioners — for instance, Upper Secondary Literature students
watched a film adaptation of their set text Boom and participated in a
dialogue session with Director Derrick Chew. Such opportunities empower
our Greenridge Champions to articulate their views, question artistic choices,
and exchange perspectives with experts, sharpening their ability to express
themselves with clarity and conviction.&nbsp;</p>
