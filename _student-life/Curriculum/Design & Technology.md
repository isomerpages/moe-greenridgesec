# **Design &amp; Technology**

### OUR BELIEFS

Our subjects are instrumental for the development and honing of practical real-life solving skills for the students. The students would be equipped with the ability to make sense of knowledge and develop critical and inventive thinking skills for the creation of effective solutions in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment.

For&nbsp;D&amp;T, the 6 essential dimensions that are characteristic of learning are:

*   Basic Thinking, Basic Technology, Project-driven Knowledge and Skills
*   Design Thinking, Doodling and Sketching, 3D Manipulation

We aim to develop designerly dispositions in our students, who are confident and able to demonstrate the ability to handle authentic-based situations, integrate varied skills such as resource management and evaluation skills and create effective solutions.


### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

We explore different pedagogies to engage our students in their learning through the various modes:

*   Teacher instructions and demonstrations
*   Peer instruction (between students) and group work
*   Self-directed learning tasks
*   Hands-on practical tasks
*   Use of ICT and e-pedagogies to support effective learning
*   Enrichment workshops and competitions platforms to enhance learning experience

### OUR STUDENTS &amp; TEACHERS @ WORK

##### Secondary One Design and Make:
Students collect data such as the measurement of their hand phones to determine the dimensions for their hand phone holder design. They use their hand phone lights to shine on their prototypes to visualise how different angles of a light source would cast different shadow effects.

##### Secondary Two Design and Make
Students cut their own paper design templates to test and make improvements to their design of a light identification holder, transfer the design using a template to an acrylic sheet material and proceed with the practical process of making their product.

##### Upper Secondary Design and Make:
Students create their design solutions and make mock ups to test their solutions for improvement.

Students discover more about electronics through exploration activities with breadboards and snap on circuits. Through collaborative work and constructive peer feedback, students make improvements in their explanation of concepts using online collaborative apps.
