<h1><strong>Mother Tongue Languages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Culture and Expression</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew for
a bilingual Singapore: <em>“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, Mother Tongue Languages are not just about communication;
they are a bridge to culture, heritage, and identity. The MTL Department
aims to provide vibrant language and cultural learning experiences that
encourage our Greenridge Champions to use their Mother Tongue in daily
life and develop a lifelong passion for their languages.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Mother Tongue Languages through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>

<p>We inspire our Champions to imagine how language shapes stories, values,
and traditions. Through programmes such as the Applied Learning Programme
(ALP), MTL Fortnight, and learning journeys, students explore possibilities
for keeping their culture alive in modern ways. Whether envisioning a new
twist on a traditional tale, reinterpreting festivals through creative
projects, or connecting heritage to contemporary life, they begin to imagine
how language can evolve while preserving its roots.</p>

<p>Our Champions discover the beauty and depth of their languages through
immersive and hands-on experiences. They take part in translation activities,
workshops, and cultural learning journeys that connect them with history
and community. From visiting places like the Peranakan Museum or Kampong
Lorong Buangkok to exploring traditional art forms and performances, they
gain a deeper appreciation of linguistic diversity and cultural expression.
These experiences strengthen their sense of identity and belonging.</p>

<p>Champions learn to express themselves confidently through writing, speech,
and performance. They participate in MTL Week and Mother Tongue Fortnight
activities that encourage storytelling, drama, and debate, showcasing both
creativity and communication skills. Whether through poetry, public speaking,
or video creation, our students articulate their thoughts clearly and share
their voices with pride and purpose.</p>
