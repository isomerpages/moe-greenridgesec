<h1><strong>Mother Tongue Languages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Culture and Expression</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew for
a bilingual Singapore: <em>“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, Mother Tongue Languages are not just about communication;
they are a bridge to culture, heritage, and identity. The MTL Department
aims to provide vibrant language and cultural learning experiences that
encourage our Greenridge Champions to use their Mother Tongue in daily
life and develop a lifelong passion for their languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Mother Tongue Languages&nbsp;&nbsp;through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Imagine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Our <strong>Greenridge Champions</strong> experience the richness of culture
through <strong>song and lyrics-writing workshops, drama activities, and cultural performances</strong>.
From composing <strong>Chinese scripts</strong> to creating <strong>Malay and Tamil song lyrics</strong>,
they imagine new ways of expressing tradition in contemporary forms. These
creative platforms encourage them to reimagine how culture can be kept
alive and relevant in a modern world, while deepening their appreciation
of heritage.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discover</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Champions explore their cultural roots through <strong>Mother Tongue Fortnight</strong> and <strong>MTL Week</strong>,
which include activities such as <strong>Malay Silat</strong>, <strong>Tamil Dance</strong>,
and <strong>Chinese Taiji</strong>. They also participate in <strong>workshops, dialogues, and cultural showcases</strong> that
open windows into traditions, values, and ways of life. These opportunities
allow them to <strong>discover heritage values, cultural practices, and the joy of learning beyond the classroom</strong>,
building stronger connections to their own identity and community.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Champions showcase their creativity and confidence in national and school-based
platforms such as the <strong>Tamil Speaking Competition “Beauty of Tamil Language”</strong>,
the <strong>Chinese Radio Drama Script Writing Competition</strong>, and
the <strong>National Secondary School Creative Writing and Poetry Competitions</strong>.
They articulate their ideas, tell stories, and share their voices through <strong>poetry, drama, translation, and public speaking</strong>.
Our <strong>Greenridge Champions have attained national recognition</strong>,
winning accolades in <strong>poetry-writing, translation, radio drama, script-writing, and oratory competitions</strong>.
These achievements reflect not only their <strong>language mastery</strong> but
also their <strong>confidence, creativity, and cultural pride</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Mother Tongue provides authentic platforms for accomplishment, where students
apply language in real-world and competitive contexts. From securing awards
in the <strong>8th National Chinese Poetry-Writing Competition</strong> to
excelling in the <strong>16th National Secondary Schools Translation Competition</strong>,
Champions demonstrate excellence and resilience. Through these experiences,
they learn the value of perseverance and take pride in seeing their hard
work celebrated at national levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Through Mother Tongue Languages, our <strong>Greenridge Champions</strong> learn
to carry forward values of <strong>empathy, respect, and responsibility</strong>.
By applying their language skills in authentic contexts such as <strong>community projects, performances, and translation work</strong>,
they contribute to <strong>Singapore’s bilingual identity</strong> and serve
as <strong>ambassadors of their culture and heritage</strong>. In doing
so, they play a vital role in strengthening the bonds between past and
present, ensuring that culture and language remain vibrant for generations
to come.&nbsp;</p>
