<h1><strong>Mother Tongue Languages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Culture and Expression</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew for
a bilingual Singapore: <em>“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, Mother Tongue Languages are not just about communication;
they are a bridge to culture, heritage, and identity. The MTL Department
aims to provide vibrant language and cultural learning experiences that
encourage our Greenridge Champions to use their Mother Tongue in daily
life and develop a lifelong passion for their languages.&nbsp;</p>

Champions demonstrate excellence and resilience. Through these experiences,
they learn the value of perseverance and take pride in seeing their hard
work celebrated at national levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Through Mother Tongue Languages, our <strong>Greenridge Champions</strong> learn
to carry forward values of <strong>empathy, respect, and responsibility</strong>.
By applying their language skills in authentic contexts such as <strong>community projects, performances, and translation work</strong>,
they contribute to <strong>Singapore’s bilingual identity</strong> and serve
as <strong>ambassadors of their culture and heritage</strong>. In doing
so, they play a vital role in strengthening the bonds between past and
present, ensuring that culture and language remain vibrant for generations
to come.&nbsp;</p>
