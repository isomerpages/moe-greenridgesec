<h1><strong>Mother Tongue Languages&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Culture and Expression</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Mr Lee Kuan Yew for
a bilingual Singapore: <em>“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary, Mother Tongue Languages are not just about communication;
they are a bridge to culture, heritage, and identity. The MTL Department
aims to provide vibrant language and cultural learning experiences that
encourage our Greenridge Champions to use their Mother Tongue in daily
life and develop a lifelong passion for their languages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our Greenridge Champions are nurtured to become persuasive communicators
through our Applied Learning Programme. With a translation component embedded
in classroom learning, they develop the ability to express themselves confidently
in both English and their Mother Tongue. From translating real-life posters
and videos to producing their own news reports, they explore creative ways
to convey information effectively. Through these experiences, they learn
to embrace linguistic and cultural diversity, fostering a deeper appreciation
for different perspectives through meaningful communication.</p>

<p>Our Champions express their thoughts and opinions confidently through
writing, speech, and actions. During Mother Tongue Fortnight and MTL Week,
they express themselves by participating in activities that showcase cultural
traditions such as traditional games. Through these enriching experiences,
our Champions further express their sense of identity and reflect on the
learning gained from their participation.</p>
