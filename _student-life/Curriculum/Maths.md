<h1><strong>Mathematics, Principles of Accounts (POA) &amp; Elements of Business Skills (EBS)</strong>&nbsp;</h1>
<h4><strong>Our Belief: Cultivating Champions of Reasoning and Innovation</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The Mathematics, POA, and EBS curriculum at Greenridge Secondary empowers
our Greenridge Champions with the knowledge, skills, and confidence to
apply learning in authentic and meaningful ways. Mathematics develops problem
solvers who think critically and logically. POA equips students with financial
literacy and analytical skills to interpret business transactions. EBS
nurtures entrepreneurial thinking and practical business awareness. Together,
these subjects foster adaptable Champions who are ready to thrive in a
rapidly evolving world.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Mathematics, POA &amp; EBS through IDEAS</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p><strong>Imagine</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Our Greenridge Champions learn to envision possibilities by tackling real-world
challenges through Mathematical Modelling tasks. They experiment with different
strategies, design solutions, and express creativity in how they present
their models. In EBS, Champions imagine themselves as entrepreneurs and
business owners during learning journeys to retail and hospitality settings,
visualising how businesses meet consumer needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Discover</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Inquiry and exploration are central to learning. In Mathematics, Champions
deepen understanding through activity-based learning and teacher-directed
inquiry, asking questions, investigating patterns, and uncovering connections
across concepts. In POA, they use Excel spreadsheets to prepare financial
reports and income statements, discovering how digital tools are applied
in professional practice. In EBS, students gain insights into the business
world through authentic observations and data collection, preparing for
coursework and future applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Express</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Champions learn to communicate their reasoning clearly, whether it is
explaining algebra during the Sec 2 Algebra Clinic, presenting mathematical
models to peers and teachers, or defending their solutions during class
discussions. EBS students express their business knowledge creatively through
activities like the Digital Tic-Tac-Toe competition, where gamification
helps them apply concepts interactively and present their choices with
confidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Accomplish</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Greenridge Champions demonstrate excellence when they apply learning in
authentic and competitive platforms. Lower Secondary students build teamwork
and resilience through Mathematical Modelling projects, while higher ability
students stretch themselves in the Australian Mathematics Competition and
the Singapore Mathematics Olympiad. EBS Champions showcase their knowledge
at the nationwide Digital Tic-Tac-Toe competition, while POA students apply
financial reporting skills with precision using ICT. These achievements
highlight the confidence and versatility our Champions bring to their disciplines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Serve</strong>&nbsp;
<br>Learning in Mathematics, POA, and EBS extends beyond examinations. Our
Greenridge Champions apply their knowledge to solve problems, analyse data,
and propose actions that can support communities and businesses. They develop
financial awareness, business literacy, and critical reasoning that empower
them to serve society responsibly as informed citizens and ethical contributors
to Singapore’s future economy.&nbsp;</p>
