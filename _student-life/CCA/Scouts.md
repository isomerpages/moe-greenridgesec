<p><strong>SCOUTS</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scouting is a worldwide youth movement dedicated to helping young people
discover, learn, and apply essential life skills through service and learning
by doing. It promotes the holistic development of youths — physically,
intellectually, emotionally, socially, and spiritually — through a non-formal,
values-based educational programme founded on the Scout Promise and Law.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge, we provide Scouts with diverse opportunities to develop
morally, physically, and cognitively through a variety of enriching experiences
such as camps, donation drives, outdoor adventures, international exchange
programmes, campfires, and outdoor cooking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Diamond Jubilee Challenge Fund-raising / Job Week</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Diamond Jubilee Challenge is a youth-led and adult-supported initiative
where our Scouts will learn more about the United Nations’ Sustainable
Development Goals,&nbsp;</p>
<p>discover their place in the community as well as what it means to be a
Singaporean, and at the same time, contribute to “Creating a Better World”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Scouts Annual Job Week serves to reinforce in our youth members the
value of honest work, and in helping others. By providing a service to
the community, Scouts invariably involve the community in their learning
and development, which is a key component of the Scout Method.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Group Camp</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Group Camp is an annual camp organised by volunteers of The Fox Scout
Group to develop the Scouts in an outside-classroom environment. During
the camp, the Scouts will have the opportunity to be trained in self-reliance
skills such as outdoor cooking, camp craft and orienteering. The Scouts
will also develop team-building skills and foster friendships as they work
with Scouts from Greenridge Secondary School and Zhenghua Secondary School​.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>National Patrol Camp</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scout Troops from across Singapore will send their choice patrol to Sarimbun
Scout Camp to participate in a jamboree-style camp that promises an unforgettable
experience for Scouts across the country. The camp has a vibrant hub of
concurrent activities, providing Scouts with a plethora of opportunities
to explore, learn and grow. It is a camp where Scouts are challenged to
do their best while keeping true to the spirit of the Scout Promise and
Law.&nbsp;</p>
