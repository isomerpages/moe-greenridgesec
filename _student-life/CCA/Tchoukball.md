<p><strong>TCHOUKBALL</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the CCA&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Greenridge Tchoukball (pronounced chook-ball) team is a testament
to grit, passion, and perseverance. What began in 2014 as a humble interest
group founded by a small group of enthusiastic players has since grown
into an established co-curricular activity (CCA). Over the years, the team
has achieved multiple accolades and built a strong reputation within the
school and beyond.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Tchoukball, we are committed to nurturing every player in
alignment with our school values — Respect, Integrity, Diligence, Grit,
and Empathy. We strive to develop self-directed learners and disciplined
student-athletes who embody these values both on and off the court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a team sport, Tchoukball teaches our players to be accountable for
their individual growth and performance, while also fostering trust, teamwork,
and unity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through well-structured fitness and skills training sessions, we aim to
deepen our players’ understanding, appreciation, and love for the game
— cultivating not just skilled athletes, but also resilient individuals
who play with heart and purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
