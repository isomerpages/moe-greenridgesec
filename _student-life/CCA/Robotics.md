<p><strong>About the CCA</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary School, our Robotics CCA offers students an exciting
and hands-on opportunity to explore the world of technology and innovation.
Through engaging national competitions and a progressive learning journey,
our students develop essential 21st-century skills such as critical thinking,
creativity, and collaboration.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Achievements and Accolades</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our CCA actively participates in two major national-level competitions:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>National Robotics Competition (Open Category):</strong> This competition
challenges students to apply <em>design thinking</em> in developing innovative
solutions to real-world problems. Students work in teams to brainstorm,
prototype, and present their ideas using robotics and programming skills.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>National Youth Tech Championship:</strong> This competition introduces
students to <em>drone technology</em>, where they learn to pilot and programme
drones to complete a series of challenges. It encourages problem-solving,
spatial awareness, and precision.&nbsp;</p>
