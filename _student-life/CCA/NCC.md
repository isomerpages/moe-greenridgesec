<p>The Greenridge National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims to nurture all-rounded
leaders of exemplary character, high physical fitness and enduring mental
strength. With a strong affiliation with the Singapore Armed Forces, NCC
offers our cadets a holistic training programme that includes outdoor adventure
activities, survival courses, overseas expeditions, water sports, as well
as exclusive opportunities to handle advanced weapons such as the SAR-21
assault rifle. Cadets who go through the Greenridge NCC programme emerge
as mature, confident and compassionate leaders.&nbsp;</p>
