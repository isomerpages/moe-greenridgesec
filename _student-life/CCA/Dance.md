<h4>OUR BELIEFS&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the GSS Modern Dance, we aim to develop confident dancers with strong
appreciation for dance, beyond its aesthetic value. This is done through
inculcating values such as tenacity and resilience as the dancers work
together towards attaining excellence in their performance.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>QUOTE(S) FROM OUR DANCERS&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“Joining Modern Dance has given me many opportunities to express myself
and have fun as dancing has been a big part of my life. Not only am I having
fun but I have also learned many things. I have learned how to persevere
through all the hardships, and I did not have to do it alone. I had all
my friends going through thick and thin with me and have built very good
relationships with them. All the experiences will be unforgettable and
I ill always remember my days in Modern Dance.” <strong>Jerlene Tan, Sec 3 (2023)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through our CCA programme, students are exposed to various dance techniques
and dance sessions which helps build their strength and flexibility. Dancers
also build camaraderie through team building games and overcoming challenges
they faced as a team. They are also given opportunities to showcase their
talents in school and in public through competitions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
