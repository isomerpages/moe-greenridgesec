<p><strong>National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) is one of the longest standing
uniformed organisations offered to youths in Secondary Schools in Singapore.
The organisation is supported by both the Ministry of Education and the
Ministry of Home Affairs. Established in 1959, our cadets are exposed to
opportunities to play a part in Singapore’s crime prevention efforts through
law enforcement knowledge to build a safe and secure society. NPCC is determined
and endeavours to develop our members to be active citizens and community
leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight
crime and keep Singapore safe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cadets engage in various activities during CCA sessions, which comprise
physical training, recreational training, outdoor camps, drills training,
police knowledge related courses, and marksmanship training. Through these
activities, cadets can strengthen their self-discipline and teamwork, gaining
insight of the operations of work in the Singapore Police Force and also
adopt some crime prevention strategies to prevent and detect crimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Journey of Personal and Leadership Development in Youths at GSS NPCC&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <strong>Secondary 1</strong>, cadets are familiarised with the history
of NPCC and the Singapore Police Force (SPF) through the visitation to
the Police Heritage Center. They are also exposed to trainings that develop
their basic campcraft and foot drill skills.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <strong>Secondary 2,</strong> cadets get their first opportunity to
fire a revolver at the Home Team Academy (HTA) range. Cadets will attend
the Adventure Training Camp at Pulau Ubin where they are given the exposure
to outdoor adventure. They consolidate and heighten their campcraft skills
and will be exposed to rifle drills to prepare themselves for the annual
Cadet Leader Course organised by NPCC HQ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <strong>Secondary 3</strong>, Cadets are given opportunities to develop
their leadership and mentoring skills as they will be taking over the role
as cadet leaders. Cadets will work with the Community Policing Unit from
Bukit Panjang Neighbourhood Police Center to conduct a public outreach
at shopping centers, spreading anti-crime messages. Cadets will also be
equipped with enhanced crime scene investigation skills at the HTA where
simulated crime scenes are analysed with the guidance of NPCC Field Instructors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At <strong>Secondary 4 or 5</strong>, cadets continue to sharpen their
leadership and mentoring skills through the planning of trainings and unit
camp(s) for the unit, together with the teacher officers and cadet inspectors.
They will also readily hand over the unit leadership responsibilities to
their Secondary 3 juniors when they step down for National Examinations.&nbsp;</p>
