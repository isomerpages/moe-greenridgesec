<h3><strong>VOLLEYBALL</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<h4><strong>Our Beliefs&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In Greenridge Secondary School’s Volleyball team, we believe that:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All players learn the importance of fair play, respect, and ethical behavior,
both towards their teammates and opponents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volleyball helps our players develop discipline, perseverance, and resilience
as they face challenges and setbacks during matches. Through victories
and defeats, they learn to handle success and failure with grace and humility,
shaping their character in the process.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Communication and collaboration among teammates are vital for achieving
success on the court. Effective communication ensures smooth coordination,
allowing players to anticipate each other’s moves and make split-second
decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Learning to trust and rely on teammates fosters a sense of camaraderie
and unity, creating a harmonious environment where everyone works towards
a common goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Quotes from Our Volleyball Girls&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>“I really enjoyed my time in volleyball as it gave me many opportunities
to grow as a person and become more confident. Though training can be tough,
the memories that I have created are unforgettable. My passion for volleyball
grew stronger after joining the CCA.”&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trilia Wong (Captain)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school volleyball team is where my passion for the sport started to
bloom. Even though the training is tough, the experience is exceptional.
My memories in training are always filled with the times when we put in
our hard work, shed sweat and sometimes, tears. However, it does not stop
me from loving the sport. Our teachers and coach are kind and patient .
Helping everyone in the team and making sure that no one is left out are
lessons I will not forget. All in all, I enjoyed my time during CCA and
had a lot of fun. &nbsp;
