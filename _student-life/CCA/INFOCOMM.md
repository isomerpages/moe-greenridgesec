<p><strong>INFOCOMM TECHNOLOGY CLUB (MEDIA PRODUCTIONS)</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the CCA</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Infocomm Technology Club (Media Productions) is a vibrant CCA where
creativity meets technology. The Club plays a key role in capturing the
heartbeat of Greenridge Secondary School. Members are the behind-the-scenes
heroes of school life—photographing and filming key moments, operating
sound systems and spotlight controls, preparing microphones, and ensuring
smooth audio-visual support for major events. From festive celebrations
and sports carnivals to Racial Harmony Day and the National Day Parade,
every snapshot and video helps preserve the school’s treasured memories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Programmes and Experiences</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members sharpen their photography and videography skills through hands-on
practice with DSLR cameras and mobile devices, guided by teachers, instructors,
and experienced peers. They explore creative genres such as toy photography,
cyberpunk photography, and light photography, applying these techniques
to real projects that document school events. Seniors and student leaders
regularly mentor juniors in areas like camera angles, composition, and
editing, fostering a strong culture of collaboration and shared expertise.
Teachers also provide guidance as students take part in national competitions
such as <em>Our Schools, Our Stories</em>, <em>Better Internet Video Challenge</em> and <em>National Cyber Wellness Challenge</em>,
helping them refine their craft while providing a platform for them to
shine.&nbsp;</p>
