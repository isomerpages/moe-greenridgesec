<h3><strong>Champion Academy</strong></h3>
<p>At Greenridge Secondary School, every student is a <strong>Champion</strong> —
a confident learner, compassionate leader, and ethical innovator. Through
our <em>Champion Academy</em>, students grow as individuals and as a community,
discovering their strengths, leading with purpose, and championing good
causes that make a difference.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Champion Houses</strong></h3>
<p>Each Greenridgean belongs to one of our eight <strong>Champion Houses</strong> — <strong>Agatha</strong>, <strong>Beethoven</strong>, <strong>Confucious</strong> and <strong>Zaha</strong> —
each inspired by a historical figure who embodied courage, creativity,
and excellence. The houses celebrate diversity in strengths and talents,
creating a sense of belonging, teamwork, and friendly competition.</p>
