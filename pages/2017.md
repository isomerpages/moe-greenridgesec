<h3><strong>Bookmarks for GSS: 28 April 2017</strong></h3>
<p>From mid-April, Parents Connect members and the Student Leaders pooled
their hearts and minds into creating handmade bookmarks for Greenrdigeans

<p><strong>Theme:</strong>
<br>Coping with Stress: At home or at school</p>
<p>Stress is physical, chemical or emotional factor that causes bodily or
mental tension. It is a way that our body responds to demands made upon
us by the environment and our relationships, and our perceptions of those
demands. The solution is to develop our coping skills, to adapt, to change,
or to find methods to solve the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Theme: Coping with Stress at Home or at School</strong>
</p>
<p>Stress “kills” as much as smoking and drinking. To prevent the harmful
effects of stress, you need to develop a habit of releasing your stress,
and of strengthening your coping skills. Join us on 16 September 2017 @
Greenridge Secondary School (GSS) to learn more from expert trainer Dr.
Carol LK Yeo, on how to help your teens understand and manage stress.</p>

<p><em>Stress is a physical, chemical or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension. It is a way that our body responds to demands made upon us by the environment and our relationships, and our perceptions of those demands. There is good stress and bad stress. Good stress builds up our resilience. Bad stress overwhelms our coping mechanisms affecting our ability to function well. Stress affects individuals differently. The symptoms are physical, cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural. The causes of stress are related to the home, school, and work environments, as well as our personality. The solution is to develop our coping skills, to adapt, to change, or to find methods to solve the problem.<br><br>This workshop enables participants to:<br>· Understand what constitutes stress<br>· Distinguish between good and bad stress<br>· Recognize the signs and results of stress<br>· Identify the sources of stress<br>· Practise how to release stress<br>· Learn how to help their children manage stress<br></em>
