# Student Leadership
### VISION AND PHILOSOPHY
We believe every student is a potential leader and we aim to develop our students to be confident and compassionate leaders, championing for good causes. We view leadership not as a rank or a position; rather, leadership is a set of essential skills that students need to be equipped with for an ever-changing world.

Leadership is a developmental process that can be taught and learned. We view leadership development as an integral part of the total school experience that we provide for every Greenridgean. As such, we provide a breadth of experiences and opportunities in which our students learn to shoulder responsibilities, demonstrate initiatives and exercise sound judgement and responsible decision-making. Through authentic leadership moments, including activities initiated and led by students themselves, Greenridgeans can discover their passions and strengths, and contribute their gifts and talents to the betterment of the community at large.

Above all, our students will develop character and resilience, as the continuum of authentic experiences allow them to develop, reflect upon and apply the values, mindsets, knowledge and skills that are necessary for them to thrive in a dynamic future.

### STUDENT LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK
In GSS, the design of the Student Leadership Programme and Community Youth Leadership (Learning for Life Programme) are guided by the 3Es (Educate, Encourage and Empower) framework, together with our school’s values to provide a meaningful learning experience for our student leaders. 

#### 3Es Framework

##### Educate 
- student population via training workshops and develop their awareness of leadership 
            theories, competencies and attitudes. 
- Student Leaders through targeted leadership development of different position holders 
            (Student Council, CCA Leaders, Class Champions and Peer Support Leaders) via 
            leadership workshops and camps.

##### Encourage
- leadership development and applications through recognition structures within the 
            school.

##### Empower leadership amongst students through:
- provisions of platforms for initiatives within the school;
-	opportunities for student-led events and programmes within the school; and
- follow-up on students’ voice and suggestions for school improvement.

##### GSS STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT APPROACH
There are four key leadership groups available for students to practise what they have learnt and stretch their potential in areas that they are interested and competent in. Together, these four leadership areas allow our students to be formally appointed in student leadership positions.

The Student Council leads the whole student body by organising, managing and carrying out school programmes, initiating activities to improve the school community and representing the school for external activities.

CCA Leaders and their committees lead their CCA teammates by organising their CCA trainings, setting and achieving goals, promoting teamwork in their CCAs and assisting their teachers with CCA matters.

Peer Support Leaders provide mental and social well-being support to their classmates and CCA mates. They also conduct activities to foster teamwork in their class and CCAs.
Class Champions and the respective subject champions lead their class in class matters, ensuring safety, encouraging their classmates to seek improvement and participating actively in school activities.
