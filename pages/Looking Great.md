At the National Design Project Exhibition, Minister Chan Chun Sing visited our exhibition booth! He posted this on his Instagram page: 

Yu Cong, Vernette, Jun Fu, Rui Jie, Ezekiel and Solano from Greenridge Secondary School (@greenridgesecsch) developed 'Remindogatchi', a device that reminds seniors to take their medications through fun emojis on a display. Simple ideas, but very useful applications.
