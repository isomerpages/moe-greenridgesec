<h3><strong>Champion Houses</strong></h3>
<p>Each Greenridgean belongs to one of our eight <strong>Champion Houses</strong> — <strong>Agatha</strong>, <strong>Beethoven</strong>, <strong>Confucius</strong>, <strong>Galileo</strong>, <strong>Leonardo</strong>, <strong>Nightingale</strong>, <strong>Teresa</strong>,
and <strong>Zaha</strong> — each inspired by a historical figure who embodied
courage, creativity, and excellence.</p>

<p>The Champion Houses nurture a sense of pride and belonging, where students
forge friendships, celebrate teamwork, and grow through friendly competition.
Through house events, activities, and leadership opportunities, Greenridgeans
learn that being a champion means striving together — <em>Together Onward.</em>
