<h1><strong>Cyber Wellness for Parents</strong></h1>
<p>Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users.
It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to
protect oneself in cyberspace.</p>
<p>MOE uses the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/social-and-emotional-learning/cyber-wellness" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Sense-Think-Act framework</u></a>&nbsp;to
