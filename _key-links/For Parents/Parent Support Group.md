The Parent Support Group is a vibrant community dedicated to fostering collaboration between parents and the school. We provide a platform for parents to share experiences, offer support, and engage in meaningful activities. Through regular meetings, workshops, and volunteer opportunities, we aim to strengthen the connection between home and school, ensuring our students receive the best possible support for their academic and personal growth. Join us in making a positive impact on our children's education and well-being.

GSS sincerely thanks all parents for their unwavering support and active involvement. Your commitment and collaboration truly make a difference in the lives of our students."
