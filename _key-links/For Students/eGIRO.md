3.  This MOE eGIRO service is currently available to account holders with the following banks: BOC, DBS/POSB, HSBC, Maybank, OCBC, SCB and UOB.  

*   Though applications with ICBC bank accounts can be submitted through the portal, they cannot be processed by school’s billing system due to system limitations. Parents are advised to use non-ICBC bank accounts as listed above if they want to set up GIRO with MOE.
