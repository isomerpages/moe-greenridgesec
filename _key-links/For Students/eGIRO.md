#### Information sheet on MOE eGIRO for Student Bills 

1.	From 5 Dec 2022, MOE has launched a new MOE eGIRO page [(https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees/egiro)](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees/egiro) for parents to sign up for GIRO online to pay for their children’s student bills. 
•	This service is not for setting up GIRO arrangement for Vendor Bills or MOE Kindergarten Bills.
•	This service is only meant for students studying in Government and Government-Aided Schools.

Use our digital service to apply for GIRO arrangement for your child's school and miscellaneous fees.



You can apply for your child's school and miscellaneous fees to be paid through GIRO. The same GIRO arrangement will also be extended to cover their payment of enrichment programmes, school charges and deduction of national examination fees (Primary School Leaving Examination and GCE Examinations), where applicable.

Account holders from the following banks can sign up for the GIRO scheme with MOE
