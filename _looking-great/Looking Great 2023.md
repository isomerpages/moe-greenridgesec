<h4><u>National Design Project Exhibition</u></h4>
<p>At the National Design Project Exhibition, Minister Chan Chun Sing visited
our exhibition booth! He posted this on his Instagram page:</p>
<p>Yu Cong, Vernette, Jun Fu, Rui Jie, Ezekiel and Solano from Greenridge
Secondary School (@greenridgesecsch) developed 'Remindogatchi', a device
that reminds seniors to take their medications through fun emojis on a
