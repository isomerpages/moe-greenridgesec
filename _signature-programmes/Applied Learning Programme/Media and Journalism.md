<h3>Media and Journalism</h3>
<p><strong>Be the Voice behind the Change</strong>
</p>
<p>In an ever-evolving media landscape, digital platforms offer powerful
ways to tell stories that matter. At Greenridge Secondary, students collaborate
in teams to produce podcasts and video documentaries that spotlight youth
perspectives and champion social change.</p>
<p>As part of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in English Language, the
New Media Journalism talent development programme equips students with
the tools to craft compelling narratives using audio, video, and editing
software.</p>
<p>Through mentorship by media professionals and authentic learning journeys,
students grow as confident communicators â€“ ready to publish their work
on social media and take part in national-level competitions such as Our
Schools, Our Stories.</p>
