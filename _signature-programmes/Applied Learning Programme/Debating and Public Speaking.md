### Debating and Public Speaking

In today’s world, global awareness, critical thinking, and effective communication is more important than ever before. For us to make a positive difference to the world around us, we need to be able to present our thoughts maturely and confidently!

Through the talent development programme of our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in English Language, we will help students to hone their public speaking skills so that they can speak with poise, eloquence and conviction, whether they are conducting an interview or delivering a speech. With the mentoring by highly experienced debate coaches and public speakers, students will be able to represent the school in national-level competitions such as the Singapore Secondary Schools Debating Championships and Orators’ Trophy.
