Overview of ALP


## What is unique about Greenridge ALP?

Greenridge Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in the English Language and Mother Tongue Languages aims to develop Greenridgeans to become confident and persuasive communicators who are ready to advocate for social issues as compassionate leaders of tomorrow.

Be immersed in new media journalism through creating digital stories and documentary videos. With these experiences, students learn to champion important issues in society that they care about. 

The ALP provides scope for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning. Through these experiences in the ALP, students will develop 21st century competencies, such as creative and inventive thinking, as well as communication and collaboration skills that prepare them for the future.

#### Developing Skills

Discover useful new skills for communicating in real-world situations. The ALP is structured using a tiered approach. In Tier 1, the programme provides all students in lower secondary with exposure to the knowledge and skills that enable them to tell powerful stories for social change through different forms of digital media. 

*   In Sec 1, the focus is on creating digital stories and podcasts, for the purposes of recounting, entertaining and reflecting on life. 
    
*   In Sec 2, students focus on producing video documentaries to raise awareness and influence change. In order to craft these video documentaries, students conduct research and interviews, and pick up skills on video production through workshops.
