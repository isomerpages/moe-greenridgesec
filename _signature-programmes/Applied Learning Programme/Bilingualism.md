<h3>Bilingualism</h3>
<p>We seek students who demonstrate a strong aptitude and passion for both
English and their Mother Tongue languages. Our bilingualism programme offers
unique opportunities for these students to:</p>
<p>• Emcee at key school events in both languages, showcasing their eloquence
and versatility;</p>
<p>• Represent the school at national-level competitions and conferences,
engaging with current issues through a bilingual and bicultural lens;</p>
<p>• Connect with distinguished professionals across diverse industries to
gain meaningful insights into the relevance of bilingualism in today's
world.</p>
<p>Through these enriching experiences, students will grow into confident,
persuasive communicators who not only excel in both languages but also
develop a deep appreciation for the richness of both cultures.</p>
