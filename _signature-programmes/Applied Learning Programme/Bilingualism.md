### Bilingualism

We offer students who are linguistically inclined in both English and Mother Tongue languages the chance to emceeing opportunities at school events using both languages, as well as representing the school at competitions and conferences at the national level. They will interact with distinguished bilingual professionals in different industries to gain deeper insights on the value of bilingualism and biculturalism. Through these experiences, they will become confident and persuasive communicators and appreciate the beauty of both languages and cultures.
