### OUR MISSION
At Greenridge Secondary School, we're all about helping students become an ethical innovator through Student-Initiated Learning (SIL). 
Through SIL, we focus on developing our students' creativity and independence, in order to create products for the good of society. Students get to Learn, Make (Imagine, Design and Create), and Champion a cause in their chosen area of interest within or outside of the curriculum. They also showcase their journeys  and experiences during our annual Learning Fest in October!

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS
Interest-based workshops are organised every term to broaden students’ learning experiences and nurture their creative mindsets. Our teachers plan for these workshops with students’ diverse interests in mind, so there's something for everyone. Through each design and creation process, we believe all Greenridgeans will grow to become ethical innovators!
