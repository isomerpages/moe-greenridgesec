# **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)**

### What is unique about Greenridge ALP?

Greenridge Applied Learning Programme (ALP) in the Languages aims to develop Greenridgeans to become creative text producers and public speakers who are ready to serve as social advocates in promoting care and togetherness.

Be prepared to delve into the world of journalism and broadcasting, digital media production, public speaking and social advocacy through our Greenridge ALP. With these experiences, students learn to champion important issues in society that they care about. 

The ALP provides scope for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning. Through these experiences in the ALP, students will develop 21st century competencies, such as creative and inventive thinking, as well as communication and collaboration skills that prepare them for the future.

### Developing Skills

The ALP is structured using a tiered approach. In Tier 1, the programme provides all students from Secondary 1 to 3 with exposure to the knowledge and skills that enable them to tell powerful stories through different forms of digital media, for a range of purposes and audiences.

In Sec 1, the focus is on creating digital narratives and personal recounts, for the purposes of recounting, entertaining and reflecting on life. 

  

In Sec 2, students focus on producing video documentaries about a hero in their community. In order to craft these video documentaries, students conduct research and interviews of these heroes, and decide on how they can tell a story about these individuals that shows appreciation for the work that they do.
