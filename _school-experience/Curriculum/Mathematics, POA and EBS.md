## OUR BELIEFS

The overarching goal of the Mathematics curriculum is to ensure that all students will achieve a level of mastery of mathematics that will serve them well in life, and for those who have the interest and ability to pursue mathematics at the highest possible level.

The Mathematics Curriculum aims to enable all students to:

*   acquire mathematical concepts and skills for continuous learning in mathematics and to support learning in other subjects;
*   develop thinking, reasoning, communication, application and metacognitive skills through a mathematical approach to problem solving;
*   connect ideas within mathematics and between mathematics and other subjects through applications of mathematics; and 
*   build confidence and foster interest in mathematics.
   
### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

Teachers use a repertoire of pedagogies to engage students in learning new concepts and skills. Three pedagogical approaches form the spine that supports most of the mathematics instruction in the classroom.

**Activity Based Learning**    
Students engage in activities to explore and learn mathematical concepts and skills, individually or in groups.

**Teacher-Directed Inquiry**    
Teachers lead students to explore, investigate and find answers on their own. Students learn to focus on specific questions and ideas and are engaged in communicating, explaining and reflecting on their answers.

**Direct Instruction**   
Teachers introduce, explain and demonstrate new concepts and skills. Teachers draw connections, pose questions, emphasise key concepts, and role-model thinking.Â
