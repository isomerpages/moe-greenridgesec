### Our Beliefs

The Science curriculum in GSS aims to instill and inspire passion and appreciation for science in our students so that they can apply what they have learnt in their life and the society where they live in. These aims are achieved through the exploration of scientific phenomena in an authentic, practical and experiential setting.

Our students are constantly engaged and inspired by the scientific phenomena and technology around them, and are encouraged to inquire and innovate, with our teachers working closely with them to ensure that our students acquire the knowledge (core ideas), skills (practices) and compass (values, ethics and attitudes) required for the challenges in the 21st century world. Students shall acquire an accomplished level of scientific literacy, to be a knowledgeable citizen who is a confident, self-directed lifelong learner and an active contributor to the community and nation.

### How We Engage Our Students

In alignment to the national Science curriculum framework and the inherent nature of Science learning through inquiry, GSS adopts a guided inquiry approach to the teaching and learning of Science in GSS. This includes the acquisition of Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes in Science through practical sessions, authentic application and making thinking visible using Thinking Routines. 

Through the Scientific Practices approach, teachers and students ‘behave like a scientist’ throughout the learning process. This means that they consistently observe, question, think, articulate and write, using the precise terms and accurate illustrations when describing the various scientific concepts, akin to a scientist. Models, demonstration kits and other manipulatives are used extensively to further provide a tactile learning experience that enhances the students’ understanding and grasp of the science concepts. 

In particular, GSS adopts the 5E Inquiry Approach (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) to facilitate and implement the progressive and differentiated Science curriculum.

*   Sec 1:  Students are engaged in interactive lessons that cover the General Science disciplines of Physics, Chemistry and Biology, to inspire them with a lifelong interest in the sciences. They are also encouraged to explore the world constantly through questioning and experimentation, so that they develop a strong sense of scientific literacy in terms of scientific knowledge, critical thinking skills and essential attitudes, which are crucial for the 21st century.  
      
    
*   Sec 2:  Students build on their fundamental Science knowledge, skills and attitudes to enhance their scientific literacy in order to explain scientific phenomena and experimental results with the use of keywords and key phrases.  
    

* Sec 3, 4 and 5:  Students deepen theirscientific knowledge, skills and attitudes  and extend their learning by analyzing data and evaluating authentic real-life problems.

### Our Students & Teachers @ Work

**Greenridge Math & Science Challenge 2020**

GSS staff and students organized the Greenridge Math & Science Challenge for the primary schools in the West Cluster, to be engaged in an application of mathematics and sciences in various rounds of games and model-making.

**Learning Journey to Edible Garden City**

Science Department teachers went on a Learning Journey at Edible Garden City for inspiration on how scientific knowledge can be applied in the production of home-grown crops and integrated with the concept of social enterprise to solve challenging first-world issues.

**Nanyang Polytechnic E-science & Technology Challenge** 

For the challenge, Sec 2 students prepared their Robot Frog using recyclable materials. The robot was tested for its ability to travel across a fixed distance of 2 meters in the shortest possible time and in the straightest possible direction.

They also built an alternative energy harvester using recycled materials which can be used to harvest sunlight, wind, waste heat or utilise mechanical means to generate electricity.

Lastly, the students used programming software such as Python and Blocky to create the shortest pathway for a robot to rescue the survivors.

**Sec 1 Science Project – Survival Island**

The students obtained drinkable water from muddy and bacteria-loaded water from the river in the island with limited amount of materials and resources given to them.

At the end of the project, students presented their plans, experimental set-ups, trials and testing, challenges faced and conclusions.

**Sec 3 Biology & Geography Learning Journey – Ecological Field Study**

This exposure gave students an opportunity to see what biologists and geographers do in Singapore and how to carry out field work in research or project work in higher education institutions.

#### Reflections by A-Star Award recipient 2019 and 2020

“I learnt a lot through this 3 day workshop at the Science Centre. As a Pure Science student, it was an amazing experience for me to be able to try these hands-on activities which aided my understanding of the topics taught in school. We also had talks by professionals about the science industry and scholarships.”

– **Claudia Tan Ying En**, 4/4’2020

“It was a really memorable and insightful experience as I got to know more about what scientists research about. Through the workshops I attended, I am more aware about the environment as well as get a taste of the life of a scientist and be more certain about which direction in life I want to pursue. Overall, I had a fun and meaningful time and would like to thank the school for allowing Jane and I to represent the school.”

– **Jophiela Yong**, 3/6’2020

#### Reflections by students who had benefitted from Science Curriculum and  Co-Curricular Programme
“The school's science programmes have exposed me to different types of experiments, concepts and learning. It has ignited my passion in Science as I found learning about new scientific concepts interesting along with getting to try different science experiments. I also learnt about the various perspectives about science. Working in groups also helps me learn how to interact well with others in the future.” – **Pearlyn Heng**, 4/5’2020

  

“I remember vividly working together with my friends for the Earth Day@Senja Square program where we helped educate the public about the environment and how to care for it.”  
– **Daniel Mirzal**, 4/4’2020

“My team presented the concept of painting with acids and bases during the Science Carnival in 2018 to Sec 1 students. It was amazing that such a simple science concept can interest others. Through such platforms, it inspired me to participate in the Science Buskers’ Competition in 2019 and represented the school in the finals.”  
– **Sng Jia Hao**, 4/4’2020

“I had a great time doing the science experiments for the Survival Island Project. It was interesting and engaging and it made me understand the science concepts better.”    
– **Ang Wei Jun**’s reflection on Survival Island Project, 1/7’2020
