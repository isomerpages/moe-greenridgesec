# **Mother Tongue**

### OUR BELIEFS

“To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage.” Mr Lee Kuan Yew, 1966

Quoting the vision of our founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew for a bilingual Singapore: To each what he originally had – his culture, his language, a link with his past, his heritage. Our Mother Tongue Languages and cultures carry many important values and thinking. Mother Tongue plays a critical role for bilingualism in Singapore. Learning of Mother Tongue Languages provides us with a channel to strengthen our core values.

  
Our GSS Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department aims to provide our students with vibrant Mother Tongue Languages and cultural learning experiences, to encourage our students to use their Mother Tongue Languages in their daily lives and develop the passion for the life-long learning of their Mother Tongue Languages.
