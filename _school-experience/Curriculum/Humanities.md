### OUR BELIEFS

The 21st century is characterized by constant change and evolution of the human and geographical landscape propelled by rapid changes to our social, economic and political contexts. To manage these challenges and maximise the available opportunities, every learner requires 21st century skills of communication, collaborative learning, critical and creative thinking skills. 

As such,  we aim  to deliver a Humanities education for students to 

*   discover and appreciate the complexities that define the human experience
    
*   apply their knowledge and skills to show care and concern for the society and world they live in and actively contribute towards a sustainable future
    
*   develop skills and dispositions to excel and embrace lifelong learning
    

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

Through Inquiry-Based Learning and Socratic Questioning, the department strives to develop deep conceptual understanding through the exploration of various issues and topics in Geography, History and Social Studies. 

The active use of technology to support Blended Learning allows students to engage in a range of learning activities within and beyond the classroom. These strategies enable teachers to be the facilitators of learning to guide students in becoming  self-directed learners who can construct knowledge for themselves.
