# **English Language & Literature**

### OUR BELIEFS

In the Department of English Language and Literature of GSS, we aim to develop our Greenridgeans to become:

*   empathetic and confident communicators
*   discerning and critical readers
*   creative inquirers
*   creative meaning makers
*   global and empathetic thinkers

Our teachers strive to proactively cater and respond to our students’ needs. We are guided by the mindset and principles that challenge us to practice differentiation in the curriculum. These include our commitment to the following:

*   creating a learning environment that encourages and supports learning
*   leading students and managing routines
*   designing quality English Language and Literature curriculum (with opportunities for applied learning)
*   implementing assessment that informs teaching and learning
*   using instruction that responds to students’ needs

In line with our belief to prepare students to be future-ready, we ensure that students have ample opportunities to learn and collaborate in ICT-enabled learning environments.

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

In the English Language curriculum, we guide students through the following stages of learning which we call CLEARR:

*   Contextualisation
*   Learn & Explore
*   Apply & Respond 
*   Reinforce

In the Literature curriculum, we enable students’ learning through:

*   Experiencing Story  
*   Interpreting Theme   
*   Appreciating Style

In all these learning experiences in the Literature curriculum, we strive to promote students’ thinking about the connections between the texts and themselves, the texts and other readers, the texts and other texts as well as the texts and the world. 

At each stage of learning in the English Language and Literature curriculum, we employ a range of pedagogical approaches to guide students through their learning, so that they can grow to become self-directed, independent learners. In supporting students’ learning, in particular, we consciously use the Gradual Release of Responsibility Framework to enable students to build the confidence in learning.

To challenge our students to deepen their learning, we design opportunities in the curriculum for them to engage in the application of their learning in authentic contexts. This ties in with the Apply & Respond stage of CLEARR.

Various programmes are designed to spark students’ interest in reading as part of the efforts to cultivate their habit to read. The Odd Week Tuesday Article Reading raises students’ awareness of current affairs and provides them with the platforms to apply their knowledge and different skills through reflection and discussions in class. Our EL and Lit subject representatives also lead the way as reading champions, while students are also invited to share their book recommendations to excite others to read.
