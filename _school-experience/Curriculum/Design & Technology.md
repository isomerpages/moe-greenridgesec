# **Design & Technology**

### OUR BELIEFS

Our subjects are instrumental for the development and honing of practical real-life solving skills for the students. The students would be equipped with the ability to make sense of knowledge and develop critical and inventive thinking skills for the creation of effective solutions in a VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment.

ForÂ D&T, the 6 essential dimensions that are characteristic of learning are:

*   Basic Thinking, Basic Technology, Project-driven Knowledge and Skills
*   Design Thinking, Doodling and Sketching, 3D Manipulation

We aim to develop designerly dispositions in our students, who are confident and able to demonstrate the ability to handle authentic-based situations, integrate varied skills such as resource management and evaluation skills and create effective solutions.


### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

We explore different pedagogies to engage our students in their learning through the various modes:

*   Teacher instructions and demonstrations
*   Peer instruction (between students) and group work
*   Self-directed learning tasks
*   Hands-on practical tasks
*   Use of ICT and e-pedagogies to support effective learning
*   Enrichment workshops and competitions platforms to enhance learning experience

### OUR STUDENTS & TEACHERS @ WORK

**Design & Technology** Lower secondary students cut their own paper design templates to test their designs of a display toy stand before proceeding with the practical making lessons.
