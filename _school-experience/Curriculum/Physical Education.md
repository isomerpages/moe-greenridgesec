# **Physical Education**

### OUR BELIEFS

The purpose of Physical Education is to enable students to demonstrate the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. We strive to develop every Greenridgean to be physically fit, and to embrace and  advocate for a healthy lifestyle.

### HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS

The following are pedagogical approaches commonly used by our teachers to engage students in learning PE Knowledge, Skills and Attitudes effectively. 

1\. Sport Education Model  

The Department adopts a modified version of Daryl Siedentop’s Sport Education Model in teaching PE. Students develop their competency, literacy and enthusiasm in sports through serving in a variety of roles in authentic sport settings. Each PE team consists of a captain, a coach, a statistician, an official, a safety officer and a media specialist. PE teams develop their teamwork and camaraderie through team identity and cheers as they work together to learn and develop sports skills and tactical play. 

2.  Games Concept Approach (GCA)

Through GCA, students learn to transfer their learning across sports with one sport to another similar game concepts, such as between Netball and Basketball (Territorial Invasion Game), Badminton and Tennis (Net-barrier Games), as well as Teeball and Softball (Fielding-Putting Games).
