# **Student Leadership**

![](/images/SL1.png)


### VISION AND PHILOSOPHY

We believe every student is a potential leader and we aim to develop our students to be Positive Youths of Today and Inspiring Leaders of Tomorrow. We view leadership not as a rank or a position; rather, leadership is a set of essential skills that students need to be equipped with for an ever-changing world.

Leadership is a developmental process that can be taught and learned. We view leadership development as an integral part of the total school experience that we provide for every Greenridgean. As such, we provide a breadth of experiences and opportunities in which our students learn to shoulder responsibilities, demonstrate initiatives and exercise sound judgement and responsible decision-making. Through authentic leadership moments, including activities initiated and led by students themselves, Greenridgeans can discover their passions and strengths, and contribute their gifts and talents to the betterment of the community at large.

Above all, our students will develop character and resilience, as the continuum of authentic experiences allow them to develop, reflect upon and apply the values, mindsets, knowledge and skills that are necessary for them to thrive in a dynamic future.

  

### STUDENT LEADERSHIP FRAMEWORK

In GSS, we adopt the 5 practices in the Leadership Challenge (TLC) Model, by James Kouzes and Barry Posner, together with our school’s values as our guiding principles to design meaningful learning experiences for our student leaders. 

The 5 practices of exemplary leadership are 

*   Model the way
    
*   Inspire a shared vision
    
*   Challenge the process
    
*   Enable others to act
    
*   Encourage the heart
    

### GSS STUDENT LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

There are five key leadership groups available for students to practice what they have learnt and stretch their potential in areas that they are interested and competent in. Together, these five leadership areas allow our students to be formally appointed in student leadership positions.

The Student Council leads the whole student body by organising, managing and carrying out school programmes, initiating activities to improve the school community and representing the school for external activities.

House Leaders and their committee lead the school through activities organised for the Houses. Every student is randomly assigned a House in Secondary One and remains in their House throughout their schooling years.

CCA Leaders and their committees lead their CCA teammates by organising their CCA trainings, setting and achieving goals, promoting teamwork in their CCAs and assisting their teachers with CCA matters.

Peer Support Leaders provide mental and social well-being support to their classmates and CCA mates. They also conduct activities to foster teamwork in their class and CCAs.

Class leaders and the respective subject representatives lead their class in class matters, ensuring safety, encouraging their classmates to seek improvement and participating actively in school activities. Student Leaders' Camp
