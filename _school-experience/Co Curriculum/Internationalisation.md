### GREENRIDGE INTERNATIONALISATION PROGRAMME

**PURPOSE**

In the globalised world, there is an increasing need for Singaporeans to possess a global outlook and operate within multi-national settings. Such a global outlook is best developed from a young age. The provision of overseas immersion by schools is key to developing this global outlook.
