# **House System**

### Background HistoryÂ  

In January 2012, Greenridge Secondary School launched our new House System. Students and staff are divided into 4 Houses, namely Cheetah, Dolphin, Falcon and Stallion. Students will remain in these Houses until they graduate from the School. The goal of the House System is to provide an opportunity for students and staff to interact and unite across levels.  

### Competitions & Accolades

Throughout the year, these 4 Houses will compete against each other for points which will contribute to the total achievement points for each House. The House with the most points at the end of the year will be named the House Champion.
