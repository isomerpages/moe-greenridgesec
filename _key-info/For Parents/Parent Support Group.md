<p><strong>Representation of the logo:</strong>
</p>
<p>The two embraced hands represent the inter relation between the parents
and the school. This in turn supports and nurtures our children, represented
by the dark blue ‘flowers’, to grow intellectually as well as build a good
character. The five ‘flowers’ represent the school values – RIDGE (respect,
integrity, diligence, grit and empathy). This inter relationship between
the parents, school and students form the basis of the school motto, Together
Onward, as we strive to grow together with each other’s support.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong>
</p>
<p>To create a supportive community where parents can share experiences,
resources, and encouragement, fostering a positive and empowering environment
for our children’s growth.</p>
<p><strong>Mission:</strong>
</p>
<p>To provide a safe and non-judgmental space for parents and children to
connect, learn, and thrive together. We aim to offer valuable resources,
expert insights, and emotional support, empowering parents to navigate
the challenges of parenthood and schooling with confidence and resilience.</p>
<p>To work together as a team with GSS as well as the students, supporting
the school’s Motto: Together Onward, for all to excel individually and
as a community.</p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong>
</p>
<p>1. Foster a sense of community: Cultivate strong connections among parents,
school teachers and students by supporting the school’s effort in creating
a conducive environment through fostering close relationships.</p>
<p>2. Provide education and resources: Equip parents with knowledge and tools
through workshops, seminars, and online resources to enhance their parenting
skills which will bring a positive outcome for our children.</p>
<p>3. Promote well-being: Prioritize the mental, emotional, and physical
well-being of parents by offering support groups, wellness activities,
and access to mental health resources in order to better manage and support
our children in their challenges.</p>
<p>4. To promote greater parental involvement in the school’s programmes.</p>
<p>5. To coordinate, support, and network with other parents as well as school
for the benefit of every child in school.</p>
<p>6. To identify needs and develop programme ideas for the growth of our
children.</p>
<p>7. Celebrate achievements: Acknowledge and celebrate the success and milestones
of parents in the support group, as well as our children thereby fostering
a positive and uplifting community culture within the school. By focusing
on these vision, mission, and goals, the parent support group can create
a meaningful and impactful space for parents to navigate the journey of
parenthood together. This will in turn bring about growth and success to
the school as well as to the students.</p>
