<p>Co-curricular activities (CCA) are necessary and important in the life
of a student. CCA is part of the holistic education delivered in an authentic
setting. <strong>We believe CCA develops and strengthens core values and 21st Century Competencies and enhances the joy of learning.</strong>
</p>
<h3>HOW WE ENGAGE OUR STUDENTS</h3>
<p>Every CCA owns a Student Development Plan (SDP) designed to enable students
to progressively learn knowledge, skills and values pertaining to the uniqueness
of their CCA. Through CCA involvement, students will get to experience
Imagine, Discover, Express, Achieve and Serve (IDEAS). CCA learning experience
enables the school to develop confident learners, compassionate leaders,
and ethical innovators.</p>
<p>Every year, we review our CCA programmes to ensure that it is well-aligned
with our school Vision, Mission, and Values. We evaluate the quality of
our CCA programmes to ensure it will allow our students achieve their personal
best in the overall CCA LEAPS 2.0 attainment.</p>
<p>Every student must participate in one core CCA.</p>
<p>To develop grit, we encourage students to stay committed to one CCA throughout
their 4 or 5 years of secondary school education. We allow CCA transfer
only for valid reasons such as a change in medical condition and we only
allow CCA transfer one time. Students with high aspirations to participate
in two CCAs can do so if they demonstrate good character and have the approval
from CCA teachers and parents.</p>
<p>These are CCAs that will be offered in 2024:</p>

<h3>CCA Orientation and CCA Selection Try-outs</h3>
<p>All Secondary Ones will participate in CCA orientation and selection try-outs
held in January over 2 weeks. We will inform students of the schedule for
CCA try-outs at the start of the year. Secondary Ones will try-out for
all CCAs before submitting their 3 CCA options. One of their 3 choices
must include a Uniformed Youth Organisation because we believe UYO is strongest
in capacity to develop student leadership skills. We will allocate students
to a CCA that is most suitable for them based on the matching of their
choices and results from the selection try-outs. New students joining the
school in Secondary Two or Secondary Three will be allocated CCA of their
choice.</p>
<h3>CCA Practice</h3>
<p>Tuesday and Thursday are our official CCA practice days. CCAs typically
start their practice at 3.00 pm and end at 5.30 pm or 6.00 pm. We advise
students to stay in school to complete their homework before the start
of CCA practice.</p>
<p>To develop diligence and grit, CCAs would include additional practice
days during their competition seasons. CCAs also conduct training camps
during weekends or school holidays to strengthen teamwork and skills among
members. Some of these camps are mandatory as it will determine student
leadership roles or school team selection. We advise students to check
their CCA holiday training plan before booking for overseas travels.</p>
<p>We will also inform parents via Parents’ Gateway should there be any change
to the regular practice scheduled. CCA will stand-down on the following
occasions:
<br>● two weeks before examinations
<br>● public holidays
<br>● Awards’ Day
<br>● National Day Celebrations
<br>● Teachers’ Day Celebrations
<br>● Parent-Child-Teacher Conference
<br>● Graduation Day</p>
<h3>GSS Games Day and Open House</h3>
<p>Students Leaders from CCA will participate in leading their CCAs during
the year-end Games Day and Open House as part of the Student Leadership
Development Programme.</p>
