# **Robotics**
Our students compete in national level competitions such as the First Lego League and National Robotics Competition (NRC) which provide them with the platforms to showcase and apply what they have learnt. These competitions require students to think about the impact of science and technology in society. Our students are also given opportunities to broaden their horizons, with enrichment programs in various fields such as Artificial Intelligence and Game Development.<br>
Our students also acquire technological expertise and develop various life skills such as perseverance, diligence, collaboration and effective communication as they strategise to perform the desired tasks.<br>

##### CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
The Robotics Club provides opportunities for our students to expand their creative, problem solving and critical thinking skills through the construction and programming of robots to tackle problems and achieve specified tasks in a fun and innovative way. Under the guidance of experienced instructors, they learn the basics of building and programming miniature robots to work smarter and move faster using LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3.
We conduct a structured training programme to prepare students for major competitions. The training sessions involve robot building techniques as well as learning the software to program the robots. In preparing for competitions, students also complete research projects on the impact of science and technology on society today.
Our students also actively champion for good causes by taking part in external events, such as the Celebrate Digital events organised by the Singapore Digital Office to promote digital inclusivity. 
Through these various activities, students develop:<br>
●	Problem-solving skills <br>
●	Research skills<br>
●	Presentation and public speaking skills<br>
Students are also given opportunities to develop their leadership skills through committee positions or to step up as team leaders during external competitions.  Our student leaders are empowered as Technical Directors and Level Coordinators to support their CCA mates in their learning and their overall well-being in the club. Working in teams, students also learn how to collaborate effectively.<br>


![](/images/ROBOTICS2023/robotics1b.jpg) It’s easy to get started in Robotics as seniors assist juniors juniors in their learning of basic coding.
![](/images/ROBOTICS2023/robotics2.jpg) Learning doesn’t always occur alone - students work in groups to achieve their learning objectives together.
![](/images/ROBOTICS2023/robotics3.jpg)Learning also doesn’t occur in a vacuum - our students are given opportunities to develop their critical and logical thinking through application to real life or relatable situations.
![](/images/ROBOTICS2023/robotics4.jpg) Our students are given opportunities to excel and demonstrate their learning through participation in competitions.
![](/images/ROBOTICS2023/robotics5.PNG) Outside of the regular Robotics program, students are also given opportunities to learn more about various fields, such as game development and artificial intelligence.
