Our Girl Guides are involved in a variety of indoor and outdoor activities that aim to develop the girls holistically. Some of our activities include the World Thinking Day and annual West Division Day where the girls conduct activities both within and beyond school. In school, our guides participate in and conduct activities such as gadget making, outdoor cooking and scavenger hunt. Additionally, in 2022, our girls also took part in the Girl Guides camp, hosted by Girl Guides Headquarters, which allowed them to interact and work with guides from other schools in Singapore.

### CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

The Greenridge Girl Guides provide opportunities for the girls to realise their full potential as responsible and confident citizens of the world. Through the range of activities offered, our girls develop holistically in character, skills and knowledge. Through the leadership opportunities available, the girls become more independent as they learn how to be leaders of selves and lead others.

Gadget Making Session: Girls are taught to make simple gadgets like clothing line, drying rack or shoe rack using materials such as wooden poles.
