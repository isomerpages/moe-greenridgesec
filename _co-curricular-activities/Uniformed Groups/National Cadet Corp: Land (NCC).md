# **National Cadet Corp – Land (NCC)**

![](/images/NCC1.jpg)

The Greenridge National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims to nurture all-rounded leaders of exemplary character, high physical fitness and enduring mental strength. With a strong affiliation with the Singapore Armed Forces, NCC offers our cadets a holistic training programme that includes outdoor adventure activities, survival courses, overseas expeditions, water sports, as well as exclusive opportunities to handle advanced weapons such as the SAR-21 assault rifle. 

Cadets who go through the Greenridge NCC programme emerge as mature and confident leaders.

**CCA COMPETITIONS & ACCOLADES**
In recognition of our efforts in grooming and developing cadets to their fullest potential, Greenridge NCC was awarded Distinction (previously called  the National Cadet Corp Best Unit Award) in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2021.
