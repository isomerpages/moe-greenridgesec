# **Scouts**

Scouting is a worldwide youth movement with the aim of helping young people develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities so that they may play constructive roles in society. This is achieved through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law and a programme with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities. In Greenridge, we provide opportunities for scouts to learn and grow morally, physically and cognitively through a wide range of activities such as camps, donation drives, outdoor activities, overseas trips, campfires and outdoor cooking.

**Job Week/ Uniformed Group Camp**

During this camp, the Scouts will participate in the annual Job Week with the Fox Scout Group. The Job Week aims to inculcate in Scouts the dignity of labour and the value of honest work. The camp is also an avenue for Scouts to have an opportunity to bond with and host a campfire for the school’s Uniformed Groups.

**Fox Scout Group Camp**

The Fox Scout Group Camp is an annual camp organised by the Fox Scout Group to develop the Scouts in an outside-classroom environment. During the camp, the Scouts will have the opportunity to be trained in self-reliance skills such as outdoor cooking, camp craft and orienteering. The Scouts will also get to develop team-building skills and foster friendships as they work with their patrols consisting of Scouts from Fajar Secondary School and Zhenghua Secondary School.  

**National Patrol Camp**

The National Patrol Camp (NPC) is a national competition event held once every two years with the aim of identifying Singapore’s Best Patrols that are proficient in Traditional Scout Craft.
