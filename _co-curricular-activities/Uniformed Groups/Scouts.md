# **Scouts**

![](/images/DSC_7942.jpg)

Scouting is a worldwide youth movement with the aim of helping young people develop their full physical, intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual capacities so that they may play constructive roles in society. This is achieved through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law and a programme with an emphasis on practical outdoor activities. In Greenridge, we provide opportunities for scouts to learn and grow morally, physically and cognitively through a wide range of activities such as camps, donation drives, outdoor activities, overseas trips, campfires and outdoor cooking.
