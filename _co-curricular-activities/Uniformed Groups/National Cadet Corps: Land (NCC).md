# **National Cadet Corps – Land (NCC)**

![Moving Together, Onward](/images/NCC2023/moving%20together,%20onward.jpg)

The Greenridge National Cadet Corps (NCC) aims to nurture all-rounded leaders of exemplary character, high physical fitness and enduring mental strength. With a strong affiliation with the Singapore Armed Forces, NCC offers our cadets a holistic training programme that includes outdoor adventure activities, survival courses, overseas expeditions, water sports, as well as exclusive opportunities to handle advanced weapons such as the SAR-21 assault rifle.
Cadets who go through the Greenridge NCC programme emerge as mature, confident and compassionate leaders.
