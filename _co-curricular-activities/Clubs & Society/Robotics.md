Our students compete in national level competitions such as the First Lego League and National Robotics Competition (NRC) which provide them with the platforms to showcase and apply what they have learnt. These competitions require students to think about the impact of science and technology in society. Students also acquire technological expertise and develop various life skills such as perseverance, diligence, collaboration and effective communication as they strategise to perform the desired tasks.
