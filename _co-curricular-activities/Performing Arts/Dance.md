“Dancing is the surely the most basic and relevant of all forms of expression.” - Lyall Watson  

Over the years, the Greenridge Secondary Dance Club have been invited to perform for external events such Bukit Panjang PAssionArts Village 2022, North West Youth Concert 2017, ZHPS Deepavali performance, and Deepavali Festival at Fajar Spring for the elderly. 

They also took part in several dance workshops, such as those organised by The Royal Dance-Off (TRDO) dance company. A few of our dancers were also selected to participate in the Dance Talent Development Programme (DTDP). 

In 2013, our dance club was part of the National Day Parade dance item at the floating platform.

The dancers are also actively involved in impacting and interacting with the community during the Performing Arts Community Project with NLB, Creative Arts Carnival in 2016 and 2017.
