A performance ensemble consisting of members of woodwind, brass and percussion families of instruments, the Greenridge Concert Band constantly aspires for excellence in biweekly practices and      performances. The Concert Band aims to expose members to various musical styles and genres, be it contemporary or standard classic literature, through performances in various settings.  
  

The Band is an integral part of Arts Education in the school. The Band performs for school-wide events like Spectrum, the biennial concert production put up by teachers and students, Awards Day, and the National Day Parade celebrations in the school. The Band also plays the role of musical hosts and has invited some schools to participate in the annual Band Exchange.

Aside from participating in nation-wide and international competitions like the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation and the Singapore International Band Festival, the Greenridge Concert Band is given opportunities to perform publicly hence constantly honing their musicality and confidence. Recently, the Band performed in the Bukit Panjang PassionArts Village 2022, regaling the community with grand fanfares and popular tunes.
