Greenridge Secondary School’s Drama Club is a nurturing community of Greenridgean thespians and orators who strive to grow as confident, creative and effective communicators. In our club, we aim to provide a platform for individuals to explore, develop, and showcase their artistic talents and passion for the performing arts. Through a combination of workshops and performances, our club strives to foster creativity, self-confidence, teamwork, and communication skills among their members.


##### QUOTES FROM OUR DRAMA STUDENTS 

“On a personal level, my involvement in drama has been an invaluable lesson in adaptability and perseverance. Through the process of navigating unforeseen changes and on-the-spot improvisations, I've learned the art of embracing challenges and finding ways to adapt. Even when faced with rigorous practices, everyone encouraged one another and united as a team. With every performance, we strive unwaveringly to present our very best.”

- Jodie Tan Sec 4 (2023)
