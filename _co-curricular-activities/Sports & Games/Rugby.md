#### QUOTES FROM OUR RUGBY BOYS 
“Personally, rugby has taught me to have more <u>**self discipline.**</u> For example, showing up and taking our training session seriously. Despite needing to train under unpredictable weather, it has taught me how to <u>**adapt to different challenges**</u>. During the fasting period, it teaches me not to give up easily and <u> **persevere**  </u> in training with the support from the teachers, coaches and the rest of the team. This leads the team to have a stronger team morale as we will have to learn and accept one another despite the team's unique characters. Rugby has taught me self-discipline, adaptability, and perseverance. With the support from the teachers, coaches and the rest of the team, we strive to give our best for every game."    
**Muhamad Amran Bin Mazli, Sec 4 (2023)**
