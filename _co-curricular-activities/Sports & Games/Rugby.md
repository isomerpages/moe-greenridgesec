n the Greenridge Secondary School’sRugby team, we believe that:  

*    All players can be trained and developed into true sportsmen, regardless of their starting point.
*   Teamwork is the beauty of our sport, where we have individuals working as one, towards a common goal. All players will emerge stronger and fitter, mentally and physically.
