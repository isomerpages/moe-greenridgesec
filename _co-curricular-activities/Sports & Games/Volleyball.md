The CCA was formed in January 2008 with the vision that every Greenridgean volleyball player will be disciplined, responsible and able to excel in both their CCA and academic studies. Beginning with 15 members, it grew to the current strength of 40. In 2012, the team qualified for the preliminary rounds for the West Zone Volleyball Championship.&nbsp;

### CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

During training practices, the players work on improving physical fitness, game tactics, as well as volleyball knowledge and skills. They take part in friendly matches against each other or other schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Opportunities are also provided for the playersâ€™ character and leadership development, such as through participating in the West Zone C Division Competition and West Zone B Division Competition. Students are also given different leadership roles to organize events and mentoring juniors in training. They also learn to contribute back to society by volunteering work at the Singapore Youth Olympics Games, SEA Games and Team Nila Inclusive Sport Programme.
