<h4><strong>CCA PROGRAMME FOR SKILLS, LEADERSHIP &amp; CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT</strong></h4>
<p>Our programme aims to equip our members with the skills and knowledge
necessary to pursue excellence in their future endeavours. We begin with
the goal of achieving success in the annual National School Games. Our
weekly training sessions not only involve physical training, but also team
building games that allow us to strengthen our awareness of each other’s
abilities and enhance our communication skills. Working in partnership
with our dedicated football coach, we also help our students develop their
community spirit and volunteerism through a range of activities.</p>
