The Greenridge Tchoukball (pronounced as chook-ball) team stems from grit and dedication. This can be seen from its humble beginnings as an interest group started by a group of passionate Tchoukball players in 2014. Since then, the team solidified its presence after multiple accolades and earned its position as an official co-curricular activity (CCA). <br>

 
#### **OUR GOALS**

In Greenridge Tchoukball, we strive to excel in inculcating critical values that aligns with the school values of Respect, Integrity, Diligence, Grit and Empathy in all our Tchoukballers. We aim to nurture them to become self-directed learners as well as disciplined student athletes. 

As a team sport, all Tchoukballers are trained to be accountable for their own training and performance as well as to have faith and trust in their teammates. 

Additionally, we aim to provide the knowledge and skills for students to understand, appreciate and love the game of Tchoukball through different fitness and skills training sessions.
