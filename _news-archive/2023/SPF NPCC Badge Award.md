Singapore Police Force-National Police Cadet Corps (SPF-NPCC) badge

The Singapore Police Force-National Police Cadet Corps (SPF-NPCC) badge is the pinnacle badge of the NPCC. It is awarded to graduating cadets who have shown outstanding leadership qualities and contributions to the corps in their four or five years of their NPCC journey. Each year, there are hundreds of cadets who go through several rounds of selection a rigorous interview process and only the top few cadets are chosen to receive this prestigious award.

This year, four of our Greenridge Secondary School NPCC cadets stood out from the rest and were awarded this pinnacle badge. These cadets are:

1.  SSGT (NPCC) Muhammad Wafiq Bin Zainol from class 4-4
2.  SSGT (NPCC) Javen Goh Hong Yi from class 4-7
3.  SI (NPCC) Daniyal Rizqi Mohd Kairi from class 4-9 and
4.  SSGT (NPCC) Qu’ratul Umaira Binte Sharifudin from class 4-12

On the 1st of April 2023, NPCC HQ held the first in-person SPF-NPCC Badge Presentation Ceremony at Home Team Academy after the Covid-19 pandemic to recognise the awardees of this pinnacle badge. Congratulations to all the recipients! We will continue to progress ‘Together Onward’ in developing our GSS NPCC cadets.
