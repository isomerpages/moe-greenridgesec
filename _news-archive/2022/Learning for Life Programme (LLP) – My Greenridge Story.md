# **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) –  My Greenridge Story**

As part of our school’s Learning for Life Programme (LLP), our Art students are attending a workshop that aims to introduce the basics of illustration, design and storytelling. Using various traditional and digital illustrative techniques and processes, the students create artworks that capture time spent in significant places around the school. Check out some of the early drafts of artworks by our students below!

The students are truly enjoying this creative process that will contribute to “My Greenridge Story” - a compilation of selected artworks to chronicle the history of the school and our students’ experiences, weaving them into a rich tapestry of memories.
