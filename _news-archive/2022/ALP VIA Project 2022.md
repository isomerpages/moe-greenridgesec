# **ALP VIA Project 2022**

As part of our journey to develop Greenridgeans who can communicate persuasively and confidently, the Secondary Two cohort recently participated in a series of workshops that taught them how to produce video documentaries. They learnt how to compose shots and edit videos so as to deliver their message effectively.

These students are excited about applying their newfound skills to produce a short video documentary on the everyday heroes within the school and the larger Bukit Panjang community as part of their Values in Action project.
