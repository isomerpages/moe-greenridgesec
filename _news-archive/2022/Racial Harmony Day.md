# **Racial Harmony Day**

Launched in 1997 as part of the Ministry of Educationâ€™s National Education programme, Racial Harmony Day is commemorated annually on 21st July. On this day, we remember the importance of respecting and maintaining the diverse fabric of life on this island-nation we call home.

The theme for Racial Harmony Day 2022 is Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic, which reflects how communities in Singapore are unique but also intertwined with others to depict the cultural diversity that characterises Singapore.
