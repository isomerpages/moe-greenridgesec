# **GCE N-Level Results Release: Supporting Your Teen**

Dear parents,

The N-Level results will be released soon. Regardless of the outcome, it is important for our teens to know that they are loved for who they are, and that their grades do not define them or their future. The social and emotional support you provide will be especially valuable and crucial in helping our teens manage their emotions and be positive when deciding on their next steps.

Do take this opportunity to have further open conversations with your teen about their interests and choices and build their pathways together.

For more resources on providing social and emotional support, affirming your teen, and supporting your teen’s transition through post N-Level education, please refer to: [https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents](https://go.gov.sg/selresforparents). You and your teen may also wish to refer to the What’s Next pamphlet ([https://go.gov.sg/whats-next-nlevel](https://go.gov.sg/whats-next-nlevel)) and available ECG resources on the MySkillsFuture Student Portal ([https://go.gov.sg/MySFSec](https://go.gov.sg/MySFSec)).

For ECG counselling services, students may contact the ECG Counsellor in their schools or the ECG Centre @ MOE (Grange Road) for online or phone counselling appointments between 12 to 24 December 2022 via

* Email: [moe\_ecg@moe.gov.sg](mailto:moe_ecg@moe.gov.sg)
* Appointment booking form: [https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre](https://go.gov.sg/moe-ecg-centre)
* Phone: 68311420 (operating hours are 9.00am to 5.00pm on weekdays; 9.00am to 12.00pm on 17 December, Saturday and 24 December, Saturday)

We encourage all students to return to their schools to collect their results. However, for those who are unable to return to school, they may view their results online. The guide on accessing the Candidates Portal ([https://myexams.seab.gov.sg](https://myexams.seab.gov.sg/)) can be found at: [https://go.gov.sg/2j0grx](https://go.gov.sg/2j0grx).
