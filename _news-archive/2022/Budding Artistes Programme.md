# **Budding Artistes Programme**

Our Greenridgeans did us proud in the Budding Artistes Programme, which aims to nurture studentsâ€™ passion for literary writing. Applying their short story and script writing skills, our students created and showcased an original skit which impressed a panel of distinguished local writers.

We would like to congratulate our winners Shanmugam Aswin(Class 2/3), Veeraselvan Sri Balaji (Class 4/1) and Sivaraman Sriram (Class 4/5) for embodying the Greenridge spirit of striving to learn beyond the classroom!
