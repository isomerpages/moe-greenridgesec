# **Esprit d’Excellence 2022**

Our Greenridgeans demonstrated enthusiasm, determination and teamwork as they actively engaged in the various activities and challenges presented to them in this annual start-of-the-year camp.

Students learnt about their own strengths and interests, as well as useful strategies to become self-directed learners. Building a positive learning culture for all, students effectively communicated with and supported their peers throughout the programme.

Definitely a wonderful start to the year! Let’s all continue to keep up the Greenridge spirit!
