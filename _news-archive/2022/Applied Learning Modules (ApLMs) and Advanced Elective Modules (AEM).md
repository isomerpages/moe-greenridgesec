# **Applied Learning Modules (ApLMs) and Advanced Elective Modules (AEM)**

### Applied Learning Modules

Where to after secondary school? With the Applied Learning Modules @ ITE, Greenridgeans would be able to make more informed choices! This programme provides students with hands-on, practical-based lessons conducted at the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) Colleges over 3 days. Our Greenridgeans got an exciting glimpse of ITE’s range of full time courses as they dabbled in various fields such as animation, digital illustration, beauty artistry and logistics operations.  
  
Check out their eventful experience!

### Advanced Elective Modules

Welcome to polytechnic life! Our Secondary 3 Express and Normal (Academic) Greenridgeans had the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to immerse themselves in Applied Learning Modules (ApLMs) and Advanced Elective Modules (AEM) in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic respectively.  
  
Our students actively engaged in authentic lessons conducted by the lecturers and industry practitioners, enriching their knowledge of several applied areas like creative modelling and entrepreneurship. Apart from acquiring new cutting-edge skills, Greenridgeans also developed more awareness about their individual interests and strengths, preparing them for their post-secondary journey.
