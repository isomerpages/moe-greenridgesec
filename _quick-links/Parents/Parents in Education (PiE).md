# **Parents in Education (PiE)**

### **New Website for Parents and Resource Pack for Schools on Home-School-Community Partnership**

1Parents can now look to the [Parents in Education (PiE) website](http://www.moe.gov.sg/parents-in-education/) for resources to help them better support the education and development of their children. Developed by the Ministry of Education (MOE), the new website was launched by Mr Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Education, at the MOE Work Plan Seminar today. Mr Heng also announced that a Partnerships Resource Pack will be provided to schools to help them to engage parents and the community.

2The PiE website will contain articles on parenting tips, educational news, information on the school curriculum, and resources for parents to support their children’s learning at home. MOE welcomes parents’ feedback on the PiE website and will continue to update and ensure relevance of the resources for parents .

3The Partnerships Resource Pack for schools includes useful tips, good stories and best practices for partnership with parents, alumni and the community.

#### **Building on Trust, Partnering as One**

4To strengthen partnership between home, school and the community, MOE has developed a Partnerships Framework, which serves to guide parents, schools and the community in their collaborative and complementary efforts, and to reach a common understanding of the goals and outcomes that they want to achieve for children’s learning and development. The framework ensures that a child’s education is supported at home and extends beyond the school into the community. The framework will be available on the PiE website. Schools will also display posters explaining the framework.

5The framework outlines five principles to guide the partners in working together. These are:

*   Trust is the foundation
*   Remember the child
*   Understand our shared responsibilities
*   Seek common ground
*   Together, we work towards common goals
