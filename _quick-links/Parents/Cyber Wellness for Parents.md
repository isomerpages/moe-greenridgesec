# **Cyber Wellness for Parents**

  
Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace.  
  
MOE uses the [Sense-Think-Act framework](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/programmes/social-and-emotional-learning/cyber-wellness) to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace.
