### **Bookmarks for GSS: 28 April 2017**

Thank you parents. It was great to have you join the Greenridge family and soak in the fun and games like the various challenges ranging from 5 ‘stones’ to skipping ropes.  Your presence certainly makes a difference to our Greenridgeans who are grateful for your support in cheering them on. We look forward to seeing you next year!
