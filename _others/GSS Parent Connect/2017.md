### **Bookmarks for GSS: 28 April 2017**

From mid-April, Parents Connect members and the Student Leaders pooled their hearts and minds into creating handmade bookmarks for Greenrdigeans as a gesture to motivate them for their upcoming examination. Pictures speak a thousand words of our students’ appreciation of their efforts!

Thank you parents. It was great to have you join the Greenridge family and soak in the fun and games like the various challenges ranging from 5 ‘stones’ to skipping ropes.  Your presence certainly makes a difference to our Greenridgeans who are grateful for your support in cheering them on. We look forward to seeing you next year!

**Theme:**   
Coping with Stress: At home or at school 

Stress is physical, chemical or emotional factor that causes bodily or mental tension. It is a way that our body responds to demands made upon us by the environment and our relationships, and our perceptions of those demands. The solution is to develop our coping skills, to adapt, to change, or to find methods to solve the problem.

**Theme: Coping with Stress at Home or at School**  

Stress “kills” as much as smoking and drinking. To prevent the harmful effects of stress, you need to develop a habit of releasing your stress, and of strengthening your coping skills. Join us on 16 September 2017 @ Greenridge Secondary School (GSS) to learn more from expert trainer Dr. Carol LK Yeo, on how to help your teens understand and manage stress.

It is a way that our body responds to demands made upon us by the environment and our relationships, and our perceptions of those demands. There is good stress and bad stress. Good stress builds up our resilience. Bad stress overwhelms our coping mechanisms affecting our ability to function well. Stress affects individuals differently. The symptoms are physical, cognitive, socio-emotional, and behavioural. The causes of stress are related to the home, school, and work environments, as well as our personality.
