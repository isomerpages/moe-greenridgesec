Returning Students include Singapore Citizens (SC) and Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) who are living and studying overseas and are not attending any local schools currently. Ministry of Education (MOE) has provided several options for school admission. Returning Singaporeans can choose one or more options based on their individual needs.
