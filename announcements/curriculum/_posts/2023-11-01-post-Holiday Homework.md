### "You may delay, but time will not.”

                                     – Benjamin Franklin

**Make use of your holidays fruitfully. 
If you work on the areas you need to do better in, prepare for 2024 by doing all the work assigned by your teachers, and take some time to rest and refresh yourself, you would feel ready for the new year. You would feel accomplished.
So do not waste this precious time. Time, once lost, is lost forever. You can never get it back.**
